If $N=9$, error bound is $1/101 \\\\approx 0.0099 < 0.01$. So $N=9$ works. Let me re-read the provided explanation. Explanation says \"N=9 is enough. Among choices, that is N=9.\" But wait, logic: N=9 implies $a_{10} \\\\approx 0.0099 < 0.01$. Is there a smaller N? $N=8 \\\\implies a_9 = 1/(81+1) = 1/82 > 0.01$. So $N=9$ is indeed the smallest integer. The provided correct option ID is C ($N=10$). Wait. $N=9$ works (error bound $1/101$). Why is correct option C ($N=10$)? Let me check options again. Options: A=4, B=9, C=10, D=11. If $N=9$ works, and B is $N=9$, B should be correct. But the JSON says `correct_option_id: \"C\"`.

Among choices, that is $N=9$.\" AND then \"Micro-explanations: B: Correct...\". But `correct_option_id` is \"C\"? This is a contradiction in the JSON. I should trust the `micro_explanations` and the MATH. B ($N=9$) is the correct math. However, if I change the correct_option_id to B, I might conflict with the user intent if they mapped it to C for some reason. But the explanation says \"Correct: $|a_{10}|...$ guarantees...\". In the micro-explanation for **B**, it says \"Correct\". In micro-explanation for **C**, it says \"Not smallest\". So the correct option ID in the JSON is WRONG. It says \"C\" but the text says \"B\" is correct. I will set `correct_option_id` to **B** (N=9) and fix the inconsistency.",

You’ll practice checking the two required conditions on a closed interval, then interpreting the conclusion as a statement about a matching instantaneous rate somewhere inside the interval. Problems include deciding whether the theorem applies (and clearly stating why), identifying an appropriate interval from a graph or context, and translating the theorem’s meaning into plain language. You’ll also work on “trap” cases where the function looks smooth but fails a condition at an endpoint or at a corner, and cases where students confuse the theorem’s conclusion with an average rate. The goal is accurate condition-checking, correct interpretation, and clean justification.",

You’ll work with sign charts, derivative graphs, and brief contextual descriptions to decide whether a point is a local maximum, local minimum, or neither. A major focus is doing the sign-change check correctly rather than assuming that “derivative equals zero” automatically means an extremum. You’ll see examples where the derivative touches zero but does not change sign, where the derivative is undefined but still produces a change from increasing to decreasing, and where multiple critical points require careful interval management. You’ll also practice writing a concise justification that matches AP expectations: identify the intervals, state the sign on each interval, and conclude the classification. Accuracy in logic, not memorization, is the target.",

        "description2": "This practice introduces the structure of optimization: define variables, build an objective, express constraints, and identify a valid domain. You’ll work on translating word problems into a single-variable model without skipping steps, with emphasis on defining what each variable represents and what quantity is being maximized or minimized. Problems include geometry and real-world contexts where you must set up relationships carefully, choose reasonable units, and identify endpoints that matter. The practice targets common modeling errors: forgetting a constraint, using an incorrect relationship, or failing to state the allowable interval for the variable. You’ll also preview the logic behind checking endpoints and interior critical points so you understand why optimization is not just “set derivative equal to zero.” The goal is clean setup and correct domain thinking before any calculus steps.",

        "description2": "This practice completes the optimization workflow from modeling to final interpretation. You’ll start from a correctly defined objective function and domain, then determine where the objective reaches a maximum or minimum on the allowed interval. Problems require you to find candidate points, check endpoints, and justify the final choice with a comparison rather than an assumption. You’ll also practice sanity checks: confirming units, ensuring the answer matches the context, and verifying that the chosen value is valid under the original constraints. Common AP-style pitfalls are built in: missing domain restrictions, failing to check endpoints, or reporting the wrong quantity (for example reporting a variable value when the question asks for a maximum area or minimum cost). The emphasis is correctness, completeness, and communicating the final result clearly in context.",

        "description2": "The Unit 5 test is a comprehensive assessment of analytical applications of differentiation. It mixes theorem-based reasoning, behavior analysis, and modeling tasks to mirror AP pacing and style. You’ll be asked to verify conditions before applying major results, interpret conclusions correctly, and avoid overgeneral statements. The test includes problems on increasing/decreasing intervals, local and absolute extrema, and concavity-based reasoning, with careful attention to endpoints and nondifferentiable points. Several items require connecting representations, such as reading information from graphs or tables and matching it to function behavior. Optimization questions emphasize correct setup, domain management, and final interpretation in context. You’ll also see implicit-relation behavior questions that test tangent conditions and validity checks. The test is designed to expose typical error patterns (missing candidates, incorrect sign logic, incomplete domain checks) while rewarding clear, disciplined reasoning.",

        "description2": "This practice focuses on understanding how an implicitly defined relationship behaves without forcing it into an explicit function form. You’ll interpret the meaning of the derivative in this setting, analyze where the relation has horizontal or vertical tangents, and connect those tangent conditions to geometric features on the curve. Problems also include identifying points that must be excluded, checking whether a point actually lies on the relation, and avoiding extraneous conclusions that come from algebraic steps. Some questions are qualitative, asking you to describe local behavior near a point; others use simple numeric information to decide whether the curve is rising steeply, flattening, or turning vertical. The goal is careful point-checking, correct tangent-condition logic, and disciplined interpretation—skills that appear frequently in AP multiple-choice and free-response contexts.",
