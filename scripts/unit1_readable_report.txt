OPTIONS:
  A: 4 ✓
  B: 2
  C: Does not exist
  D: 0

GENERAL EXPLANATION: Rewrite and simplify: $$\frac{x^2-4}{x-2}=\frac{(x-2)(x+2)}{x-2}=x+2\quad (x\ne 2).$$ So $$\lim_{x\to 2}\frac{x^2-4}{x-2}=\lim_{x\to 2}(x+2)=4.$$

Correct Answer: A

PROMPT: Use the graph in the image.  What is $$\lim_{x\to 2} f(x)?$$
IMAGE: https://xzpjlnkirboevkjzitcx.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/mixed_c...

OPTIONS:
  A: Does not exist ✓
  B: 0
  C: $+\infty$
  D: $-\infty$

GENERAL EXPLANATION: From the graph, there is a vertical asymptote at $x=2$. The function decreases without bound as $x\to 2^-$ and increases without bound as $x\to 2^+$. Since the one-sided behaviors are not equal, the two-sided limit does not exist.

MICRO EXPLANATIONS:
  A: As $x\to 2^-$, $f(x)\to -\infty$ and as $x\to 2^+$, $f(x)\to +\infty$, so the two-sided limit does not exist.
  B: Confuses the $x$-axis intersection with the limit at $x=2$.
  C: That is only the right-hand behavior; two-sided limit requires both sides match.
  D: That is only the left-hand behavior; two-sided limit requires both sides match.

PROMPT: Use the table in the image.  What is the best estimate of $$\lim_{x\to 2} g(x)?$$
IMAGE: https://xzpjlnkirboevkjzitcx.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/mixed_c...

OPTIONS:
  A: 3.6
  B: 3.9
  C: 4.4
  D: 4.0 ✓

GENERAL EXPLANATION: As $x$ gets closer to $2$ from the left, $g(x)$ is near $4$, and from the right, $g(x)$ is also near $4$. Both sides approach $4$, so the best estimate is $4.0$.

MICRO EXPLANATIONS:
  A: Correct. Vertical asymptotes occur where the function value goes to infinity, while horizontal asymptotes occur as the variable approaches infinity.
  B: Incorrect. Distinguish between horizontal asymptotes (behavior at infinity) and vertical asymptotes (infinite growth at a single point).
  C: Incorrect. Distinguish between horizontal asymptotes (behavior at infinity) and vertical asymptotes (infinite growth at a single point).

PROMPT: Evaluate the limit using limit laws.  $$\lim_{x\to -1}\left(\frac{3}{x+2}+\frac{2x}{x^2+3}\right)$$

OPTIONS:
  A: $\frac{5}{2}$ ✓
  B: $\frac{5}{4}$
  C: $\frac{1}{2}$

OPTIONS:
  A: 0
  B: 1
  C: $\frac12$ ✓
  D: 2

GENERAL EXPLANATION: Rationalize: $$\frac{\sqrt{1+x}-1}{x}\cdot\frac{\sqrt{1+x}+1}{\sqrt{1+x}+1}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1+x}+1}.$$ Then $$\lim_{x\to 0}\frac{1}{\sqrt{1+x}+1}=\frac12.$$

PROMPT: Let $$f(x)=\begin{cases} \frac{x^2-1}{x-1},& x\ne 1\\ 7,& x=1 \end{cases}$$ Which statement is true?

OPTIONS:
  A: $\lim_{x\to 1}f(x)=7$
  B: $\lim_{x\to 1}f(x)=2$ but $f(1)=7$ ✓
  C: $\lim_{x\to 1}f(x)$ does not exist because $f(1)$ is defined differently
  D: $\lim_{x\to 1}f(x)=7$ and $f$ is continuous at $x=1$

GENERAL EXPLANATION: For $x\ne 1$, $\frac{x^2-1}{x-1}=x+1$, so $$\lim_{x\to 1}f(x)=\lim_{x\to 1}(x+1)=2,$$ but $f(1)=7$. The limit exists; the function is not continuous at $x=1$.

MICRO EXPLANATIONS:
  A: Correct. The Intermediate Value Theorem (IVT) states that if a continuous function takes different values at the ends of an interval, it must take all values in between.
  B: Incorrect. To apply IVT, the function must be continuous on the closed interval [a, b].

OPTIONS:
  A: Does not exist
  B: 1
  C: -1
  D: 0 ✓

GENERAL EXPLANATION: Because $-1\le \sin(\frac{1}{x})\le 1$, multiplying by $x^2\ge 0$ gives $$-x^2\le x^2\sin(\frac{1}{x})\le x^2.$$ As $x\to 0$, both bounds go to $0$, so by the Squeeze Theorem the limit is $0$.

Correct Answer: B

PROMPT: A student wants to estimate $\lim_{x\to 1} f(x)$.  Which set of $x$-values is most appropriate for a numerical estimate of the limit?

OPTIONS:
  A: $x=0.5,\ 0.6,\ 0.7,\ 0.8$
  B: $x=0.9,\ 0.99,\ 0.999,\ 1.001,\ 1.01,\ 1.1$ ✓
  C: $x=1.1,\ 1.2,\ 1.3,\ 1.4$
  D: $x=1,\ 1,\ 1,\ 1$

GENERAL EXPLANATION: To estimate a two-sided limit numerically, choose $x$-values that approach the target from both sides and get very close without being exactly equal to the target. Option D satisfies this.

MICRO EXPLANATIONS:
  A: Incorrect. Please check if the left-hand and right-hand limits agree, or if there is an indeterminate form (like 0/0) requiring simplification.

OPTIONS:
  A: Removable discontinuity
  B: Jump discontinuity ✓
  C: Infinite discontinuity
  D: No discontinuity (continuous)

GENERAL EXPLANATION: From the graph, as $x\to 1^-$, $h(x)\to 2$ (open circle). As $x\to 1^+$, $h(x)\to 3$ (right-hand segment). Since the one-sided limits are finite but unequal, the discontinuity is a jump discontinuity.

PROMPT: Suppose $f$ is continuous on $[1,5]$, with $f(1)=-2$ and $f(5)=4$. Which statement must be true?

OPTIONS:
  A: There exists $c$ in $(1,5)$ such that $f(c)=0$ and $f'(c)$ exists.

  D: There exists $c$ in $(1,5)$ such that $f(c)=6$.

GENERAL EXPLANATION: By the Intermediate Value Theorem, if $f$ is continuous on $[1,5]$, then for any value $L$ between $f(1)=-2$ and $f(5)=4$, there exists $c\in(1,5)$ with $f(c)=L$. Since $0$ is between $-2$ and $4$, such a $c$ must exist.

  B: $f$ is continuous at $x=2$.
  C: $\lim_{x\to 2} f(x)=5$ and the discontinuity is removable. ✓
  D: $x=2$ is a jump discontinuity.

GENERAL EXPLANATION: Since $\lim_{x\to 2^-}f(x)=\lim_{x\to 2^+}f(x)=5$, the two-sided limit exists and equals $5$. Because $f(2)$ is undefined, $f$ is not continuous at $2$, but the discontinuity is removable: defining $f(2)=5$ restores continuity.

GENERAL EXPLANATION: Average velocity on $[1,3]$ is the slope of the secant line: $$\frac{s(3)-s(1)}{3-1}=\frac{(3^2+2\cdot 3)-(1^2+2\cdot 1)}{2}=\frac{15-3}{2}=6.$$

MICRO EXPLANATIONS:
  A: Distance change only.
  B: Correct secant slope with units mph.
  C: Uses [0,5], not [2,5].
  D: Instantaneous rate at one time.

PROMPT: Compute the instantaneous rate of change of $g(x)=\sqrt{x}$ at $x=9$ using the limit definition $$g'(9)=\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{\sqrt{9+h}-3}{h}.$$

OPTIONS:
  A: $\dfrac{1}{3}$
  B: $\dfrac{1}{18}$
  C: $\dfrac{1}{6}$ ✓
  D: $\dfrac{1}{9}$

GENERAL EXPLANATION: Rationalize: $$\frac{\sqrt{9+h}-3}{h}\cdot\frac{\sqrt{9+h}+3}{\sqrt{9+h}+3} =\frac{(9+h)-9}{h(\sqrt{9+h}+3)} =\frac{1}{\sqrt{9+h}+3}.$$ Then $$\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{1}{\sqrt{9+h}+3}=\frac{1}{3+3}=\frac{1}{6}.$$

OPTIONS:
  A: $12$ ✓
  B: $6$
  C: $8$
  D: $4$

GENERAL EXPLANATION: Compute: $$(2+h)^3=8+12h+6h^2+h^3.$$ So $$\frac{(2+h)^3-8}{h}=\frac{12h+6h^2+h^3}{h}=12+6h+h^2.$$ Taking $h\to 0$ gives $12$.

PROMPT: Suppose $\lim_{x\to 4} f(x)=7$. Which statement must be true?

OPTIONS:
  A: $f(4)=7$
  B: For values of $x$ close to $4$ (but not necessarily equal to $4$), $f(x)$ can be made arbitrarily close to $7$. ✓
  C: $f(x)=7$ for all $x$ near $4$
  D: $\lim_{x\to 7} f(x)=4$

GENERAL EXPLANATION: The statement $\lim_{x\to 4} f(x)=7$ means that for $x$ sufficiently close to $4$ (with $x\ne 4$ allowed), the values $f(x)$ can be made as close to $7$ as desired.

MICRO EXPLANATIONS:

PROMPT: For $x\ne 1$, define $$f(x)=\frac{|x-1|}{x-1}.$$ Which statement is correct?

OPTIONS:
  A: $f(1)=0$
  B: $$\lim_{x\to 1} f(x)=1$$
  C: $$\lim_{x\to 1} f(x)=-1$$
  D: $$\lim_{x\to 1^-} f(x)=-1\\ \text{and}\\ \lim_{x\to 1^+} f(x)=1$$ ✓

GENERAL EXPLANATION: If $x>1$, then $|x-1|=x-1$ so $f(x)=1$. If $x<1$, then $|x-1|=-(x-1)$ so $f(x)=-1$. Therefore $$\lim_{x\to 1^-} f(x)=-1,\qquad \lim_{x\to 1^+} f(x)=1,$$ so the two-sided limit does not exist.

  B: $5$
  C: $8$ ✓
  D: $-8$

GENERAL EXPLANATION: Use limit laws: $$\lim_{x\to 2}(f(x)-3)=\lim_{x\to 2}f(x)-3=5,$$ so $$\lim_{x\to 2}f(x)=8.$$

  B: $$\lim_{x\to 5^-} f(x)$$ ✓
  C: $$\lim_{f(x)\to 5^-} x$$
  D: $$\lim_{x\to 5} f(5)$$

OPTIONS:
  A: Does not exist ✓
  B: $1$
  C: $0$

OPTIONS:
  A: The limit does not exist
  B: $4$
  C: $3$ ✓
  D: $2$

GENERAL EXPLANATION: As $x\to 2^-$, the graph follows the left branch. The $y$-values approach $3$ (the open circle at $(2,3)$). Therefore, $\lim_{x\to 2^-} f(x)=3$.

MICRO EXPLANATIONS:
  A: A one-sided limit can exist even if the two-sided limit fails; from the left the values approach a single number.
  B: $4$ is the function value shown by the filled point at $x=2$, not the left-hand limit.
  C: Approaching $x=2$ from the left follows the left linear branch, which approaches $y=3$ at the open circle.

OPTIONS:
  A: The limit does not exist ✓
  B: $3$
  C: $1$
  D: $2$

GENERAL EXPLANATION: From the left, $f(x)$ approaches $3$ (open circle at $(1,3)$). From the right, $f(x)$ approaches $1$ (horizontal segment). Since $\lim_{x\to 1^-} f(x)\neq \lim_{x\to 1^+} f(x)$, $\lim_{x\to 1} f(x)$ does not exist.

MICRO EXPLANATIONS:
  A: Left-hand and right-hand limits are different ($3$ from the left and $1$ from the right), so the two-sided limit does not exist.
  B: $3$ matches the left-hand approach (open circle), but the right-hand approach is different.
  C: $1$ matches the right-hand approach (and the filled point), but the left-hand approach is different.

  C: $\infty$ ✓
  D: The limit does not exist

GENERAL EXPLANATION: Near $x=0$ on the right, the graph shoots upward without bound. Therefore, $\lim_{x\to 0^+} f(x)=\infty$.

MICRO EXPLANATIONS:
  A: The branch shown for $x>0$ rises upward as $x\to 0^+$, not downward.
  B: The $x$-axis is not being approached; the $y$-values grow large.

GENERAL EXPLANATION: Approaching $x=-1$ from either side, the graph stays at $y=1$. Even though there is a hole at $(-1,1)$, the approaching value is $1$, so $\lim_{x\to -1} f(x)=1$.

MICRO EXPLANATIONS:
  A: A hole does not prevent a limit from existing; the surrounding values can still approach one number.
  B: Near $x=-1$, the graph lies on the horizontal line $y=1$ with a hole at $(-1,1)$, so the limit is $1$.

Correct Answer: A

PROMPT: Using the graph (see image 1.5-P2.png), evaluate $$\lim_{x\to 1}\left(3f(x)-2g(x)\right).$$
IMAGE: https://xzpjlnkirboevkjzitcx.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/mixed_c...

OPTIONS:
  A: $8$ ✓
  B: $4$
  C: $-8$
  D: Does not exist

GENERAL EXPLANATION: From the graph, $$\lim_{x\to 1}f(x)=2,\quad \lim_{x\to 1}g(x)=-1.$$ By limit laws, $$\lim_{x\to 1}(3f(x)-2g(x))=3\cdot 2-2\cdot(-1)=8.$$

MICRO EXPLANATIONS:
  A: This uses the correct limits from the graph: $f\to 2$, $g\to -1$.
  B: This uses incorrect graph reading for one of the limits.
  C: This comes from sign mistakes when computing $-2g$.
  D: Both $f$ and $g$ approach finite values at $x=1$, so the limit exists.

OPTIONS:
  A: $\frac{10}{4}$
  B: Does not exist
  C: $\frac{25}{-10}$
  D: $\frac{25}{4}$ ✓

GENERAL EXPLANATION: By limit laws, $$\lim_{x\to 2}\frac{(f(x))^2}{g(x)+7}=\frac{(\lim f(x))^2}{\lim(g(x)+7)}=\frac{5^2}{-3+7}=\frac{25}{4}.$$

MICRO EXPLANATIONS:

Correct Answer: B

PROMPT: Evaluate (or state that it does not exist): $$\lim_{x\to 2}\frac{x+1}{x^2-4}.$$

OPTIONS:
  A: $\frac{3}{0}$
  B: Does not exist (unbounded) ✓
  C: $\frac{3}{4}$
  D: $0$

GENERAL EXPLANATION: Factor $x^2-4=(x-2)(x+2)$. As $x\to 2$, the numerator $x+1\to 3$ while the denominator $(x-2)(x+2)\to 0$. A nonzero number divided by something approaching $0$ becomes unbounded, so the two-sided limit does not exist.

MICRO EXPLANATIONS:
  A: A limit cannot be left as “divide by zero.”
  B: Nonzero over $0$ implies unbounded behavior.
  C: Denominator at $2$ is $0$, not $4$.
  D: Would require numerator $\to 0$.

OPTIONS:
  A: $0$ ✓
  B: $-1$
  C: Does not exist
  D: $1$

GENERAL EXPLANATION: Because the denominator approaches $-1+2=1\neq 0$, substitute directly: $$\lim_{x\to -1}\frac{x^2+3x+2}{x+2}=\frac{(-1)^2+3(-1)+2}{-1+2}=\frac{0}{1}=0.$$

GENERAL EXPLANATION: Rationalize: $$\frac{\sqrt{1+x}-1}{x}\cdot\frac{\sqrt{1+x}+1}{\sqrt{1+x}+1}=\frac{(1+x)-1}{x(\sqrt{1+x}+1)}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1+x}+1}.$$ Then $$\lim_{x\to 0}\frac{1}{\sqrt{1+x}+1}=\frac{1}{2}.$$

OPTIONS:
  A: $\sqrt{3}$
  B: $2\sqrt{3}$ ✓
  C: $6$
  D: $\frac{1}{2\sqrt{3}}$

GENERAL EXPLANATION: Multiply by the conjugate: $$\frac{x-3}{\sqrt{x}-\sqrt{3}}\cdot\frac{\sqrt{x}+\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{x}+\sqrt{3}}=\frac{(x-3)(\sqrt{x}+\sqrt{3})}{x-3}=\sqrt{x}+\sqrt{3}.$$ Then $$\lim_{x\to 3}(\sqrt{x}+\sqrt{3})=2\sqrt{3}.$$

PROMPT: A function has the graph shown (see image 1.6-P5.png). What value should be defined at $x=3$ to make the function continuous at $x=3$?
IMAGE: https://xzpjlnkirboevkjzitcx.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/mixed_c...

OPTIONS:
  A: $3$
  B: $0$
  C: $6$ ✓
  D: No value works

GENERAL EXPLANATION: To make $f$ continuous at $x=3$, define $f(3)$ to equal the two-sided limit. The graph shows a hole at $(3,6)$, so $$\lim_{x\to 3}f(x)=6$$ and the required definition is $f(3)=6$.

MICRO EXPLANATIONS:
  A: This confuses the $x$-coordinate with the needed $y$-value.
  B: This would create a jump from the approaching value shown on the graph.

OPTIONS:
  A: DNE because there is a hole
  B: $2$
  C: $\tfrac{1}{2}$ ✓
  D: DNE because there is a jump

GENERAL EXPLANATION: Near $x=-1$, the curve follows the line segment on both sides and approaches the open-circle height. The filled point at $x=-1$ changes $f(-1)$ but not the limit.

MICRO EXPLANATIONS:
  A: A hole does not prevent the limit from existing if both sides approach the same value.

  B: $h(a)$ is undefined
  C: $\lim_{x\to a} h(x)$ does not exist ✓

  B: $1$
  C: $-1$
  D: $0$ ✓

GENERAL EXPLANATION: Use $-1\le \cos(\frac{1}{x})\le 1$. Multiplying by $x^2\ge 0$ gives $-x^2\le x^2\cos(\frac{1}{x})\le x^2$. As $x\to 0$, both $\pm x^2\to 0$, so the limit is $0$.

OPTIONS:
  A: $0$ ✓
  B: DNE
  C: $1$
  D: The limit depends on the path to $0$

GENERAL EXPLANATION: Since $-1\le \sin(\frac{1}{x})\le 1$, we have $-|x|\le x\sin(\frac{1}{x})\le |x|$. As $x\to 0$, both $-|x|$ and $|x|$ approach $0$, so by the Squeeze Theorem the limit is $0$.

MICRO EXPLANATIONS:
  A: Because $-1\le \sin(1/x)\le 1$, multiplying by $x$ gives $-|x|\le x\sin(1/x)\le |x|$, and both bounds go to $0$.
  B: The oscillation is bounded by functions that both go to $0$, so the limit exists.
  C: The middle function stays between $-|x|$ and $|x|$, which both shrink to $0$.

  B: DNE ✓
  C: $-1$
  D: $1$

GENERAL EXPLANATION: Even though $-1\le \sin(\frac{1}{x})\le 1$, the bounds do not squeeze to a single value. Near $0$, the function attains values arbitrarily close to many numbers in $[-1,1]$, so the limit does not exist.

MICRO EXPLANATIONS:
  A: Although values hit $0$ infinitely often, they also hit values near $1$ and $-1$ arbitrarily close to $0$.
  B: The function oscillates between $-1$ and $1$ without approaching a single value.

OPTIONS:
  A: $3.61$
  B: $4$ ✓
  C: $4.41$
  D: Does not exist

GENERAL EXPLANATION: As $x$ gets closer to $2$ from both sides, the function values get closer to $4$, so $\lim_{x\to 2} f(x)\approx 4$.

MICRO EXPLANATIONS:
  A: That is $f(1.9)$, not the value approached near $x=2$.
  B: The values $3.9601$ and $4.0401$ cluster around $4$, suggesting the limit is $4$.
  C: That is $f(2.1)$, which is farther from $2$ than $2.01$.
  D: The table suggests approach toward a single value from both sides, so the limit exists.

PROMPT: Define $h(x)=\dfrac{|x-2|}{x-2}$ for $x\ne 2$. Which statement is true?

OPTIONS:
  A: $\lim_{x\to 2} h(x)=0$
  B: $\lim_{x\to 2} h(x)=1$
  C: $\lim_{x\to 2} h(x)$ does not exist ✓
  D: $h(x)=1$ for all $x\ne 2$

GENERAL EXPLANATION: If $x>2$, then $|x-2|=x-2$ so $h(x)=1$. If $x<2$, then $|x-2|=-(x-2)$ so $h(x)=-1$. Since the one-sided limits are different, $\lim_{x\to 2} h(x)$ does not exist.

PROMPT: The graph of $f$ is shown in the figure labeled 1.10-P1. What type of discontinuity does $f$ have at $x=1$?
IMAGE: https://xzpjlnkirboevkjzitcx.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/mixed_c...

OPTIONS:
  A: Removable discontinuity
  B: Jump discontinuity ✓
  C: No discontinuity
  D: Infinite discontinuity

GENERAL EXPLANATION: At $x=1$, the function approaches one finite value from the left and a different finite value from the right, so the discontinuity is a jump discontinuity.

MICRO EXPLANATIONS:
  A: A removable discontinuity would have matching one-sided limits. Here the left and right behaviors do not approach the same value.
  B: The left-hand limit and right-hand limit are finite but unequal, indicating a jump.
  C: The left and right sides do not meet at one common value.
  D: An infinite discontinuity requires unbounded behavior near $x=1$, which is not shown.

OPTIONS:
  A: $0$
  B: $6$ ✓
  C: $3$
  D: No value works

GENERAL EXPLANATION: Factor $x^2-9=(x-3)(x+3)$. For $x\ne 3$, $p(x)=x+3$, so $\lim_{x\to 3} p(x)=6$. Continuity requires $p(3)=6$.

MICRO EXPLANATIONS:

PROMPT: The graph of $f$ is shown in the figure labeled 1.10-P3. Which statement is true about limits near $x=0$?
IMAGE: https://xzpjlnkirboevkjzitcx.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/mixed_c...

OPTIONS:
  A: $\lim_{x\to 0^-} f(x)=-\infty$ and $\lim_{x\to 0^+} f(x)=+\infty$ ✓
  B: $\lim_{x\to 0^-} f(x)=+\infty$ and $\lim_{x\to 0^+} f(x)=+\infty$
  C: $\lim_{x\to 0} f(x)=0$
  D: $\lim_{x\to 0} f(x)$ exists and is finite

GENERAL EXPLANATION: From the graph, as $x\to 0^-$ the function decreases without bound, and as $x\to 0^+$ it increases without bound. Therefore $\lim_{x\to 0^-} f(x)=-\infty$ and $\lim_{x\to 0^+} f(x)=+\infty$.

MICRO EXPLANATIONS:
  A: The left branch goes downward without bound and the right branch goes upward without bound, indicating a vertical asymptote at $x=0$.
  B: On the left side the graph goes to $-\infty$, not $+\infty$.
  C: The function values do not approach $0$; they grow without bound in magnitude.
  D: The function is unbounded near $x=0$, so a finite two-sided limit cannot exist.

PROMPT: At $x=a$, a function has $\lim_{x\to a^-} f(x)=5$ and $\lim_{x\to a^+} f(x)=5$, but $f(a)$ is not defined. What type of discontinuity is at $x=a$?

OPTIONS:
  A: No discontinuity
  B: Jump discontinuity
  C: Infinite discontinuity
  D: Removable discontinuity ✓

GENERAL EXPLANATION: Because both one-sided limits equal $5$, the two-sided limit exists and equals $5$. Since $f(a)$ is undefined, the discontinuity can be removed by defining $f(a)=5$.

MICRO EXPLANATIONS:
  A: Review this option carefully and compare with the correct answer.
  B: If they match and are finite, the limit exists.
  C: Missing or mismatched function value implies removable discontinuity.

PROMPT: A function $f$ has $\lim_{x\to 4^-} f(x)=2$ and $\lim_{x\to 4^+} f(x)=2$. Also $f(4)=7$. Which statement is true?

OPTIONS:
  A: $f$ is continuous at $x=4$ because both one-sided limits exist
  B: $\lim_{x\to 4} f(x)=7$
  C: $f$ has a removable discontinuity at $x=4$ ✓
  D: $f$ has a jump discontinuity at $x=4$

GENERAL EXPLANATION: Since $\lim_{x\to 4^-} f(x)=\lim_{x\to 4^+} f(x)=2$, the two-sided limit exists and equals $2$. Because $f(4)=7\ne 2$, the discontinuity is removable.

MICRO EXPLANATIONS:
  A: Equal one-sided limits imply $\lim_{x\to 4} f(x)=2$.
  B: Compare $f(4)$ to the limit.

PROMPT: Let $f(x)=\begin{cases} x^2-1, & x \ne 1 \\\\ 3, & x=1 \end{cases}$. Which statement is true about continuity at $x=1$?

OPTIONS:
  A: Continuous because limits exist
  B: Not continuous because limit does not exist ✓
  C: Not continuous because $f(1)$ is undefined
  D: Not continuous because $\lim_{x\to 1}f(x) \ne f(1)$

GENERAL EXPLANATION: $\lim_{x\to 1} (x^2-1) = 0$. But $f(1)=3$. Since limit (0) $\ne$ value (3), $f$ is not continuous at $x=1$.

MICRO EXPLANATIONS:
  A: Compute the limit from the defining formula for $x\ne 1$ and compare to $f(1)$.

PROMPT: Use the graph (image). At $x=2$, which statement is true?  I. $\lim_{x\to 2} f(x)$ exists.  II. $f(2)$ exists.  III. $f$ is continuous at $x=2$.
IMAGE: https://xzpjlnkirboevkjzitcx.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/mixed_c...

OPTIONS:
  A: I only
  B: I and II only
  C: II only ✓
  D: I, II, and III

GENERAL EXPLANATION: From the graph, there is a filled point at $x=2$, so $f(2)$ exists. The value approached from the left differs from the value approached from the right, so $\lim_{x\to 2} f(x)$ does not exist. Without the limit, $f$ cannot be continuous at $x=2$.

MICRO EXPLANATIONS:
  A: The two-sided limit does not exist because the left- and right-hand limits are different.
  B: II is true, but I is false and therefore III is also false.
  C: Correct: the graph shows a filled point at $x=2$ so $f(2)$ exists; the left and right limits differ so the two-sided limit does not exist; hence not continuous.
  D: If the two-sided limit existed and $f(2)$ existed, continuity would still require equality; here the limit does not exist.

PROMPT: Find the value of $k$ that makes $f$ continuous at $x=3$ if $f(x) = \begin{cases} \frac{x^2-9}{x-3}, & x \ne 3 \\ k, & x=3 \end{cases}$

OPTIONS:
  A: $k=6$ ✓
  B: $k=9$
  C: $k$ cannot be chosen to make $f$ continuous at $x=3$
  D: $k=0$

GENERAL EXPLANATION: For $x \ne 3$, factor $x^2-9 = (x-3)(x+3)$, so $f(x) = x+3$. Thus $\lim_{x\to 3} f(x) = 6$. Continuity at $x=3$ requires $f(3)=k$ to equal this limit, so $k=6$.

MICRO EXPLANATIONS:
  A: Removable discontinuities can be fixed by redefining the point.
  B: Simplify to $x+3$ then evaluate at $x=3$.
  C: Limit is of $x+3$, not $x^2$.

PROMPT: Let $f(x)=\begin{cases} 2x+1, & x<0 \\ x^2+1, & x\ge 0 \end{cases}$. Is $f$ continuous at $x=0$?

OPTIONS:
  A: No, because the left-hand limit and right-hand limit are different
  B: Yes, because both formulas are polynomials
  C: No, because $f(0)$ does not exist
  D: Yes, because $\lim_{x\to 0^-}f(x) = \lim_{x\to 0^+}f(x) = f(0)$ ✓

GENERAL EXPLANATION: Check one-sided limits: $\lim_{x\to 0^-} (2x+1) = 1$. $\lim_{x\to 0^+} (x^2+1) = 1$. Also $f(0) = 0^2+1 = 1$. Since limits match and equal $f(0)$, $f$ is continuous.

MICRO EXPLANATIONS:
  A: Check left limit, right limit, and the value.

OPTIONS:
  A: $(-\infty,\infty)$
  B: $(-\infty,4)$
  C: $[4,\infty)$
  D: $(-\infty,4]$ ✓

GENERAL EXPLANATION: The function $g(x)=\sqrt{4-x}$ is defined when $4-x\ge 0$, i.e., $x\le 4$. Since $\sqrt{\cdot}$ and linear functions are continuous where defined, $g$ is continuous on $(-\infty,4]$ (with one-sided continuity at the endpoint).

OPTIONS:
  A: $k=2$
  B: $k=1$
  C: $k=-1$
  D: $k=0$ ✓

GENERAL EXPLANATION: The only possible discontinuity is at the split point $x=2$. Continuity requires $h(2) = \lim_{x\to 2^+} (x^2-2)$. Since $h(2) = 2k+2$ and the right-hand value is $2^2-2=2$, set $2k+2=2$, giving $k=0$.

OPTIONS:
  A: $[0,4]$
  B: $[0,1]$
  C: $[0,1)\cup(1,4]$ ✓

MICRO EXPLANATIONS:
  A: There is a discontinuity at $x=1$, so $f$ is not continuous on the entire interval.
  B: At $x=1$ the graph shows a mismatch between the approached value and the defined value, so not continuous on $[0,1]$.

  A: $a=1,\\ b=4$
  B: $a=2,\\ b=0$
  C: $a=3,\\ b=-2$ ✓
  D: $a=0,\\ b=4$

GENERAL EXPLANATION: For $x<2$, $$\frac{x^2-4}{x-2}=\frac{(x-2)(x+2)}{x-2}=x+2\quad(x\ne 2),$$ so $\lim_{x\to 2^-} h(x)=4$. Continuity at $x=2$ uses the right branch, so $$h(2)=2a+b=4.$$ Also $h(3)=3a+b=7$. Subtract to get $a=3$, then $2(3)+b=4$ gives $b=-2$.

OPTIONS:
  A: Does not exist
  B: $3$
  C: $0$
  D: $\frac{3}{2}$ ✓

GENERAL EXPLANATION: Rationalize: $$\frac{\sqrt{1+3x}-1}{x}\cdot\frac{\sqrt{1+3x}+1}{\sqrt{1+3x}+1} =\frac{(1+3x)-1}{x(\sqrt{1+3x}+1)} =\frac{3}{\sqrt{1+3x}+1}.$$ As $x\to 0$, this approaches $\frac{3}{2}$.

PROMPT: Let $$p(x)=\frac{(x-1)(x+2)}{(x-1)^2}.$$ Which statement is true?

OPTIONS:
  A: $x=1$ is a removable discontinuity (a hole)
  B: $\lim_{x\to 1}p(x)$ is finite
  C: $x=-2$ is a vertical asymptote
  D: $x=1$ is a vertical asymptote and $\lim_{x\to 1^+}p(x)=+\infty$ ✓

GENERAL EXPLANATION: Cancel one factor: $$p(x)=\frac{(x-1)(x+2)}{(x-1)^2}=\frac{x+2}{x-1}\quad(x\ne 1).$$ The denominator still approaches $0$ at $x=1$, so there is a vertical asymptote at $x=1$. For $x\to 1^+$, $x-1\to 0^+$ and $x+2\to 3$, hence $p(x)\to +\infty$.

  C: $x=1$

GENERAL EXPLANATION: Factor: $$x^2-4x+3=(x-1)(x-3),\quad x^2-5x+6=(x-2)(x-3).$$ Then for $x\ne 3$, $$q(x)=\frac{(x-1)(x-3)}{(x-2)(x-3)}=\frac{x-1}{x-2}.$$ The canceled factor creates a hole at $x=3$, while the remaining denominator zero gives a vertical asymptote at $x=2$.

OPTIONS:
  A: $y=\frac{5}{2}x$
  B: $y=0$
  C: $y=\frac{5}{2}$ ✓

  D: No horizontal asymptote

GENERAL EXPLANATION: For $$f(x)=\frac{3x^2+1}{x^2-4},$$ the degrees match, so $$\lim_{x\to\pm\infty} f(x)=\frac{3}{1}=3.$$ Thus the horizontal asymptote is $y=3$.

  C: There exists $c\in(2,7)$ such that $f(c)=-4$.
  D: $f$ must be increasing on $[2,7]$.

PROMPT: Let $f(x)=x^3-6x+1$. Use the Intermediate Value Theorem to justify that there is a solution to $f(x)=-2$ in the interval $(0,1)$. Which calculation correctly supports the conclusion?

OPTIONS:
  A: Let $g(x)=f(x)+2$. Then $g(0)=3$ and $g(1)=-2$, so there exists $c\in(0,1)$ with $g(c)=0$, i.e., $f(c)=-2$. ✓
  B: $f(0)=1$ and $f(1)=-4$, so there is a solution to $f(x)=0$.
  C: $f(0)=-2$ and $f(1)=2$, so there is a solution to $f(x)=-2$.
  D: $f(0)=1$ and $f(1)=-4$, so there is a solution to $f(x)=2$.

GENERAL EXPLANATION: Define $g(x)=f(x)+2$. Since $f$ is a polynomial, $g$ is continuous on $[0,1]$. Compute: $$g(0)=f(0)+2=(1)+2=3,\quad g(1)=f(1)+2=(-4)+2=-2.$$ Because $g(0)>0$ and $g(1)<0$, IVT guarantees a $c\in(0,1)$ with $g(c)=0$, so $f(c)=-2$.

PROMPT: Consider $$h(x)=\frac{x^2-9}{x-3}.$$ Which statement is correct about using the Intermediate Value Theorem to guarantee a solution to $h(x)=4$ on the interval $[2,5]$?

OPTIONS:
  A: IVT applies on $[2,5]$ because $h$ is a rational function.
  B: IVT applies on $[2,5]$ only if $h(3)=6$ is defined.
  C: IVT applies on $[2,5]$ because $h(x)=x+3$ after simplification.
  D: IVT does not apply on $[2,5]$ because $h$ is not continuous on $[2,5]$. ✓

GENERAL EXPLANATION: IVT requires continuity on the entire closed interval. The function $$h(x)=\frac{x^2-9}{x-3}$$ is undefined at $x=3$, and $3\in[2,5]$, so $h$ is not continuous on $[2,5]$. Therefore IVT cannot be applied on that interval to guarantee a solution to $h(x)=4$.
