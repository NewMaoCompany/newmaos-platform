PROMPT: A tank contains $W(t)$ liters of water. At $t=4$ minutes, $W(4)=120$ and the net rate of change is $W'(4)=-3$. Which interpretation is correct?
CORRECT: D = "At $t=4$, water is leaving the tank $3$ L/min faster than it is entering."
  A : At $t=4$, water is entering the tank at $3$ L/min.
  B : At $t=4$, the tank contains $-3$ liters of water.
  C : From $t=3$ to $t=4$, exactly $3$ liters left the tank.
  D ✓: At $t=4$, water is leaving the tank $3$ L/min faster than it is entering.
EXPLANATION: $W'(4)=-3$ L/min means the amount of water is decreasing at 3 L/min at that moment, so outflow exceeds inflow by 3 L/min.

PROMPT: Use linearization at $x=4$ to approximate $\sqrt{4.1}$.
CORRECT: B = "$2.025$"
  A : $2.01$
  B ✓: $2.025$
  C : $2.05$
  D : $2.1$
EXPLANATION: Let $f(x)=\sqrt{x}$. Then $f(4)=2$ and $f'(x)=\frac{1}{2\sqrt{x}}$, so $f'(4)=\frac{1}{4}$. Linearization $L(x)=2+\frac{1}{4}(x-4)$ gives $\sqrt{4.1}\approx L(4.1)=2.025$.

PROMPT: A particle moves along a line with velocity $v(t)=t^2-4t+1$ (m/s). On what interval(s) is the particle moving to the left?
CORRECT: A = "$(2-\sqrt{3},\,2+\sqrt{3})$"
  A ✓: $(2-\sqrt{3},\,2+\sqrt{3})$
  B : $(-\infty,0)$
  C : $(2+\sqrt{3},\,\infty)$
  D : Never
EXPLANATION: Moving left means $v(t)<0$. Solve $t^2-4t+1<0$. The roots are $t=2\pm\sqrt{3}$. Since the parabola opens upward, it is negative between the roots, so the particle moves left on $(2-\sqrt{3},\,2+\sqrt{3})$.

  A : $0$
  B : $1$
  C : Does not exist
  D ✓: $5$
EXPLANATION: Use $\lim_{u\to 0}\frac{\sin u}{u}=1$ with $u=5x$: $\frac{\sin(5x)}{x}=5\cdot\frac{\sin(5x)}{5x}\to 5$.

CORRECT: B = "$-\frac{3}{4}$"
  A : $-\frac{3}{2}$
  B ✓: $-\frac{3}{4}$
  C : $\frac{3}{2}$
  D : $\frac{3}{4}$
EXPLANATION: Using $x^2+y^2=100$, differentiate: $2x\frac{dx}{dt}+2y\frac{dy}{dt}=0$, so $\frac{dy}{dt}=-\frac{x}{y}\frac{dx}{dt}$. When $x=6$, $y=\sqrt{100-36}=8$, so $\frac{dy}{dt}=-\frac{6}{8}(2)=-\frac{3}{4}$ ft/s.

PROMPT: Sand falls onto a conical pile so that the volume increases at $\frac{dV}{dt}=12$ ft$^3$/min. The pile maintains the ratio $\frac{r}{h}=\frac{1}{3}$. When $h=6$ ft, how fast is the height increasing, $\frac{dh}{dt}$?
CORRECT: C = "$\frac{3}{\pi}$"
  A : $\frac{1}{\pi}$
  B : $\frac{9}{\pi}$
  C ✓: $\frac{3}{\pi}$
  D : $\frac{27}{\pi}$
EXPLANATION: With $r=\frac{h}{3}$, $V=\frac{1}{3}\pi r^2h=\frac{\pi}{27}h^3$. Differentiate: $\frac{dV}{dt}=\frac{\pi}{9}h^2\frac{dh}{dt}$. At $h=6$, $12=\frac{\pi}{9}(36)\frac{dh}{dt}=4\pi\frac{dh}{dt}$, so $\frac{dh}{dt}=\frac{3}{\pi}$ ft/min.

PROMPT: A company's profit (in millions of dollars) is $P(x)$ where $x$ is the number of thousands of units sold. At $x=30$, $P(30)=12$ and $P'(30)=0.4$. Which is the best interpretation of $P'(30)=0.4$?
CORRECT: A = "When 30,000 units have been sold, profit is increasing at about $0.4$ million dollars per additional 1,000 units sold."
  A ✓: When 30,000 units have been sold, profit is increasing at about $0.4$ million dollars per additional 1,000 units sold.
  B : When 30,000 units have been sold, profit is increasing at about $0.4$ million dollars per unit sold.
  C : After 30,000 units are sold, profit will be $0.4$ million dollars.
  D : From 29,000 to 30,000 units sold, profit increased by exactly $0.4$ million dollars.
EXPLANATION: Since $x$ is in thousands of units, $P'(30)=0.4$ means profit changes by about $0.4$ million dollars for each additional $1{,}000$ units sold at $x=30$.

PROMPT: The temperature of a chemical reactor (in $^\circ$C) is modeled by $T(t)=80+20e^{-0.1t}$, where $t$ is in minutes. What is the instantaneous rate of change of temperature at $t=0$?
CORRECT: A = "$-2$"
  A ✓: $-2$
  B : $-0.1$
  C : $2$
  D : $-20$
EXPLANATION: Differentiate: $T'(t)=20(-0.1)e^{-0.1t}=-2e^{-0.1t}$. Thus $T'(0)=-2$ $^\circ$C/min.

  A ✓: $\frac{5}{4\pi}$
  B : $\frac{50}{\pi}$
  C : $\frac{5}{2\pi}$
  D : $\frac{25}{2\pi}$
EXPLANATION: Differentiate $A=\pi r^2$: $\frac{dA}{dt}=2\pi r\frac{dr}{dt}$. At $r=20$, $50=2\pi(20)\frac{dr}{dt}$, so $\frac{dr}{dt}=\frac{50}{40\pi}=\frac{5}{4\pi}$ m/min.
MICRO:
  A: Correct. Linearization uses the tangent line equation L(x) = f(a) + f'(a)(x-a) to approximate function values near the point of tangency.

CORRECT: B = "$31.7$"
  A : $32.3$
  B ✓: $31.7$
  C : $31.85$

CORRECT: D = "$0.04$"
  A : $0.2$
  B : $0.2\ln 5$
  C : $5$
  D ✓: $0.04$
EXPLANATION: For $f(x)=\ln x$, $f'(x)=\frac{1}{x}$. With $x=5$ and $dx=0.2$, $df\approx f'(5)dx=\frac{1}{5}(0.2)=0.04$.

CORRECT: C = "$2$"
  A : $0$
  B : $1$
  C ✓: $2$
  D : Does not exist
EXPLANATION: This is $\frac{0}{0}$. Apply L'Hospital: first derivative gives $\lim_{x\to 0}\frac{2e^{2x}-2}{2x}=\lim_{x\to 0}\frac{e^{2x}-1}{x}$, still $\frac{0}{0}$. Apply again: $\lim_{x\to 0}\frac{2e^{2x}}{1}=2$.

CORRECT: B = "$8.24$"
  A : $8.12$
  B ✓: $8.24$
  C : $8.08$
  D : $8.00$
EXPLANATION: Linearization: $L(x)=f(2)+f'(2)(x-2)$. With $f'(x)=3x^2$, $f'(2)=12$. Thus $f(2.02)\approx 8+12(0.02)=8.24$.

CORRECT: D = "$t=2-\sqrt{3}$"
  A : $t=\frac{1}{2}$
  B : $t=1$
  C : $t=2+\sqrt{3}$
  D ✓: $t=2-\sqrt{3}$
EXPLANATION: Since $v'(t)=a(t)=6t-12$, integrate: $v(t)=3t^2-12t+C$. Using $v(0)=3$ gives $C=3$. Solve $3t^2-12t+3=0\Rightarrow t^2-4t+1=0\Rightarrow t=2\pm\sqrt{3}$. The first positive time is $t=2-\sqrt{3}$.

CORRECT: B = "$\frac{1}{2}(0.1)^2$"
  A : $\frac{1}{2}(0.1)$
  B ✓: $\frac{1}{2}(0.1)^2$
  C : $0.05$
  D : $\frac{1}{6}(0.1)^3$
EXPLANATION: For $f(x)=\sin x$, $f^{(3)}(x)=-\sin x$, so $|f^{(3)}(x)|\le 1$ near 0. The first-order remainder satisfies $|R_1(x)|\le \frac{M}{2}(x-a)^2$ with $M=1$, $a=0$, $x=0.1$, so $|R_1|\le \frac{1}{2}(0.1)^2=0.005$.

PROMPT: A company's weekly profit is modeled by $P(t)=120t-5t^2$, where $P$ is in thousands of dollars and $t$ is measured in weeks since a new product launch. Which statement best interprets $P'(8)$?
CORRECT: D = "At $t=8$, the profit is increasing at $40$ thousand dollars per week."
  A : At $t=8$, the profit is decreasing and equals $P'(8)$ thousand dollars.
  B : At $t=8$, the profit will be $40$ thousand dollars next week.
  C : At $t=8$, the profit is decreasing at $40$ thousand dollars per week.
  D ✓: At $t=8$, the profit is increasing at $40$ thousand dollars per week.
EXPLANATION: Compute $P'(t)=120-10t$, so $P'(8)=120-80=40$. Because $P'(8)>0$, profit is increasing at that instant at a rate of $40$ thousand dollars per week.

(Let $x$ be the distance from pole to person and $s$ be the shadow length.)
CORRECT: A = "$0.75$ m/s"
  A ✓: $0.75$ m/s
  B : $1.0$ m/s
  C : $1.5$ m/s
  D : $3.0$ m/s
EXPLANATION: From similar triangles, $$\frac{6}{x+s}=\frac{2}{s}\;\Rightarrow\;6s=2(x+s)\;\Rightarrow\;4s=2x\;\Rightarrow\;s=\frac{x}{2}.$$ Differentiate: $$\frac{ds}{dt}=\frac{1}{2}\frac{dx}{dt}=\frac{1}{2}(1.5)=0.75\text{ m/s}.$$

PROMPT: Two cars start from the same intersection. Car A travels east at $30$ mph and Car B travels north at $40$ mph. How fast is the distance between the cars increasing $2$ hours after they start?
CORRECT: C = "$50$ mph"
  A : $25$ mph
  B : $70$ mph
  C ✓: $50$ mph
  D : $100$ mph
EXPLANATION: Let $x=30t$ and $y=40t$. Then $$d=\sqrt{x^2+y^2}=\sqrt{(30t)^2+(40t)^2}=\sqrt{2500t^2}=50t.$$ Therefore $\dfrac{dd}{dt}=50$ mph for all $t$, including $t=2$.

PROMPT: Use linear approximation to estimate $\sqrt{10}$ by linearizing $f(x)=\sqrt{x}$ at $x=9$.
CORRECT: B = "$3.166\overline{6}$"
  A : $3.1$
  B ✓: $3.166\overline{6}$
  C : $3.333\overline{3}$
  D : $3.0$
EXPLANATION: Linearization at $a=9$ is $L(x)=f(9)+f'(9)(x-9)$. Since $f(9)=3$ and $$f'(x)=\frac{1}{2\sqrt{x}}\;\Rightarrow\; f'(9)=\frac{1}{6},$$ we get $$\sqrt{10}=f(10)\approx L(10)=3+\frac{1}{6}(10-9)=3.166\overline{6}.$$

CORRECT: D = "$2.025$"
  A : $2.05$
  B : $2.00$
  C : $2.10$
  D ✓: $2.025$
EXPLANATION: Write $\sqrt{4.1}=\sqrt{(3.1)+1}=f(3.1)$ for $f(x)=\sqrt{x+1}$. Linearization at $a=3$: $$L(x)=f(3)+f'(3)(x-3).$$ Compute $f(3)=2$ and $$f'(x)=\frac{1}{2\sqrt{x+1}}\;\Rightarrow\; f'(3)=\frac{1}{4}.$$ Then $$\sqrt{4.1}=f(3.1)\approx L(3.1)=2+\frac{1}{4}(0.1)=2.025.$$

  C: Incorrect. The accuracy of a linear approximation depends on the distance from the point of tangency; whether it is an over- or under-estimate depends

PROMPT: Use differentials to approximate $\sqrt[3]{65}$ by linearizing $g(x)=x^{\frac{1}{3}}$ at $x=64$.
CORRECT: A = "$4.020833\ldots$"
  A ✓: $4.020833\ldots$
  B : $4.25$
  C : $4.01$
  D : $3.979167\ldots$
EXPLANATION: Let $g(x)=x^{\frac{1}{3}}$. Then $g(64)=4$ and $$g'(x)=\frac{1}{3}x^{\frac{-2}{3}}.$$ Since $64^{2/3}=(\sqrt[3]{64})^2=16$, we have $g'(64)=\dfrac{1}{3\cdot 16}=\dfrac{1}{48}$. Thus $$\sqrt[3]{65}=g(65)\approx g(64)+g'(64)(65-64)=4+\frac{1}{48}=4.020833\ldots.$$

  A : $12.16$
  B ✓: $11.84$
  C : $11.2$
  D : $12.8$
EXPLANATION: Local linearity at $x=5$ gives $$f(5.2)\approx f(5)+f'(5)(5.2-5)=12+(-0.8)(0.2)=11.84.$$

PROMPT: Let $f(x)=\ln x$. Using the linearization at $x=1$, which estimate is closest to $\ln(1.05)$?
CORRECT: C = "$0.05$"
  A : $0.0513$
  B : $-0.05$
  C ✓: $0.05$
  D : $0.025$
EXPLANATION: For $f(x)=\ln x$, $f(1)=0$ and $f'(1)=1$. The linearization at $x=1$ is $$L(x)=f(1)+f'(1)(x-1)=x-1.$$ So $$\ln(1.05)\approx L(1.05)=1.05-1=0.05.$$

CORRECT: B = "$3$"
  A : $0$
  B ✓: $3$
  C : $1$
  D : $\infty$
EXPLANATION: This is a $\frac{0}{0}$ form. Using the standard limit $\lim_{u\to 0}\frac{\sin u}{u}=1$ with $u=3x$, $$\lim_{x\to 0}\frac{\sin(3x)}{x}=3\lim_{u\to 0}\frac{\sin u}{u}=3.$$ Equivalently, by L’Hospital, $$\lim_{x\to 0}\frac{\sin(3x)}{x}=\lim_{x\to 0}\frac{3\cos(3x)}{1}=3.$$

CORRECT: C = "$\frac{1}{2}$"
  A : $0$
  B : $1$
  C ✓: $\frac{1}{2}$

EXPLANATION: This is a $\frac{0}{0}$ form. Apply L’Hospital twice: $$\lim_{x\to 0}\frac{e^x-1-x}{x^2} =\lim_{x\to 0}\frac{e^x-1}{2x}\quad(\frac{0}{0}) =\lim_{x\to 0}\frac{e^x}{2} =\frac{1}{2}.$$ The table in figure 4.7-P2 is consistent with values approaching $0.500000\ldots$.

  B : $\displaystyle \lim_{x\to 2}\frac{x^2-4}{x-2}$
  C : $\displaystyle \lim_{x\to 0}(1+\sin x)$
  D ✓: $\displaystyle \lim_{x\to \infty}\frac{3x+1}{2x-5}$

  A : $0$
  B : $\frac{1}{6}$
  C ✓: $-\frac{1}{6}$
  D : Does not exist
EXPLANATION: This is a $\frac{0}{0}$ form. Apply L’Hospital three times: $$\lim_{x\to 0}\frac{\sin x-x}{x^3} =\lim_{x\to 0}\frac{\cos x-1}{3x^2} =\lim_{x\to 0}\frac{-\sin x}{6x} =\lim_{x\to 0}\frac{-\cos x}{6} =-\frac{1}{6}.$$
