--- 3.0-UT-Q10 [5/5] [Both] ---
PROMPT: If $x\cos y=y^2$ and $(0,0)$ lies on the curve, what is the slope of the tangent line at $(0,0)$?
CORRECT: D = "Does not exist"
  A : $0$
  B : $1$
  C : $-1$
  D ✓: Does not exist
EXPLANATION: Differentiate implicitly: $$\frac{d}{dx}(x\cos y)=\cos y-x\sin y\frac{dy}{dx},\quad \frac{d}{dx}(y^2)=2y\frac{dy}{dx}.$$ So $$\cos y-x\sin y\frac{dy}{dx}=2y\frac{dy}{dx}.$$ At $(0,0)$ this becomes $1=0$, impossible for any finite $\frac{dy}{dx}$. Therefore, a finite tangent slope at $(0,0)$ does not exist.

  A ✓: $-\frac{5}{4}$
  B : $-\frac{4}{5}$
  C : $\frac{5}{4}$
  D : $-\frac{3}{4}$
EXPLANATION: Differentiate: $$2x+\frac{d}{dx}(xy)+2y\frac{dy}{dx}=0,\quad \frac{d}{dx}(xy)=y+x\frac{dy}{dx}.$$ So $$(2x+y)+(x+2y)\frac{dy}{dx}=0.$$ At $(2,1)$: $$5+4\frac{dy}{dx}=0\Rightarrow \frac{dy}{dx}=-\frac{5}{4}.$$

  C : $\dfrac{2x\sin(x^2+1)}{\cos(x^2+1)}$
  D ✓: $\dfrac{2x\cos(x^2+1)}{\sin(x^2+1)}$
EXPLANATION: Let $u=\sin(x^2+1)$. Then $q(x)=\ln u$ so $q'(x)=\dfrac{u'}{u}$. Also $u'=\cos(x^2+1)\cdot 2x$. Thus $$q'(x)=\frac{2x\cos(x^2+1)}{\sin(x^2+1)}.$$

  B : $-\dfrac{2x}{x^2+3}$
  C : $-\dfrac{2xy}{x^2}$
  D ✓: $-\dfrac{2xy}{x^2+3}$
EXPLANATION: Differentiate implicitly: $(x^2y)'+(3y)'=0$. Product rule gives $2xy+x^2y'$, and $(3y)'=3y'$. Thus $2xy+(x^2+3)y'=0$, so $$\frac{dy}{dx}=y'=-\frac{2xy}{x^2+3}.$$

PROMPT: If $\sin(xy)=x$, what is $\dfrac{dy}{dx}$?
CORRECT: B = "$\dfrac{1-y\cos(xy)}{x\cos(xy)}$"
  A : $\dfrac{y\cos(xy)-1}{x\cos(xy)}$
  B ✓: $\dfrac{1-y\cos(xy)}{x\cos(xy)}$
  C : $\dfrac{1-y\cos(xy)}{\cos(xy)}$
  D : $\dfrac{1-y\sin(xy)}{x\cos(xy)}$
EXPLANATION: Differentiate: $(\sin(xy))'=\cos(xy)\cdot(xy)'=1$. Since $(xy)'=y+xy'$, we have $(y+xy')\cos(xy)=1$. Thus $$y'=\frac{1-y\cos(xy)}{x\cos(xy)}.$$

  A : $\dfrac{25}{64}$
  B ✓: $-\dfrac{25}{64}$
  C : $-\dfrac{3}{4}$
  D : $-\dfrac{4}{3}$
EXPLANATION: Differentiate $x^2+y^2=25$: $2x+2yy'=0\Rightarrow y'=-\dfrac{x}{y}$. Differentiate $y'=-xy^{-1}$: $$y''=-(y^{-1}+x(-1)y^{-2}y')=-\frac{1}{y}+\frac{xy'}{y^2}.$$ At $(3,4)$, $y'=-\dfrac{3}{4}$, so $$y''=-\frac{1}{4}+\frac{3(\frac{-3}{4})}{16}=-\frac{1}{4}-\frac{9}{64}=-\frac{25}{64}.$$

  B : $\dfrac{2x+y}{e^{y}+x}$
  C : $\dfrac{2x+y}{e^{y}}$
  D : $\dfrac{2x+xy}{e^{y}-x}$
EXPLANATION: Differentiate: $(e^{y})'=e^{y}y'$. RHS: $(x^2)'=2x$ and $(xy)'=y+xy'$. So $$e^{y}y'=2x+y+xy'.$$ Then $(e^{y}-x)y'=2x+y$, hence $$\frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{2x+y}{e^{y}-x}.$$

  B : $\dfrac{1}{2}$
  C ✓: $-\dfrac{1}{2}$
  D : $-2$
EXPLANATION: Use $(f^{-1})'(y)=\dfrac{1}{f'(f^{-1}(y))}$. Since $f(1)=4$, $f^{-1}(4)=1$. Therefore $$ (f^{-1})'(4)=\frac{1}{f'(1)}=\frac{1}{-2}=-\frac{1}{2}. $$

CORRECT: D = "$1$"
  A : $0$
  B : $\dfrac{1}{3}$
  C : $3$
  D ✓: $1$
EXPLANATION: First solve $f(x)=0$: $x^3+x=x(x^2+1)=0\Rightarrow x=0$, so $g(0)=0$. Next $f'(x)=3x^2+1$, so $f'(0)=1$. Therefore $$ g'(0)=\frac{1}{f'(g(0))}=\frac{1}{f'(0)}=1. $$

EXPLANATION: Find $f^{-1}(0)$ by solving $\ln(x+2)=0\Rightarrow x+2=1\Rightarrow x=-1$. Then $f'(x)=\dfrac{1}{x+2}$, so $f'(-1)=1$. Hence $$ (f^{-1})'(0)=\frac{1}{f'(f^{-1}(0))}=\frac{1}{f'(-1)}=1. $$
