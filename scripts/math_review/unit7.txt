PROMPT: A population $P(t)$ (in bacteria) satisfies $\dfrac{dP}{dt}=kP$ for a constant $k$. If $P(0)=500$ and $P(2)=800$, which value of $k$ is correct?
CORRECT: D = "$k=\dfrac{1}{2}\ln(1.6)$"
  A : $k=\ln(1.6)$
  B : $k=\dfrac{800-500}{2}$
  C : $k=\dfrac{\ln(800)}{\ln(500)}$
  D ✓: $k=\dfrac{1}{2}\ln(1.6)$
EXPLANATION: Solve $P(t)=500e^{kt}$. Then $800=500e^{2k}$ so $e^{2k}=1.6$ and $k=\tfrac12\ln(1.6)$.

PROMPT: Which function satisfies the differential equation $y''=2y-x$ for all $x$?
CORRECT: A = "$y=Ce^{2x}+\dfrac{x}{2}+\dfrac{1}{4}$"
  A ✓: $y=Ce^{2x}+\dfrac{x}{2}+\dfrac{1}{4}$

  C : $y=Ce^{x}+\dfrac{x}{2}+\dfrac{1}{4}$
  D : $y=Ce^{2x}+\dfrac{x}{4}+\dfrac{1}{4}$
EXPLANATION: Try $y=Ce^{2x}+ax+b$. Then $y''=2Ce^{2x}+a$ and $2y-x=2Ce^{2x}+(2a-1)x+2b$. Match coefficients: $2a-1=0\Rightarrow a=\tfrac12$ and $a=2b\Rightarrow b=\tfrac14$.

--- 7.0-UT-Q4 [4/4] [Both] ---
PROMPT: For the differential equation $\dfrac{dy}{dx}=y(2-y)$, which statement is true?
CORRECT: D = "$y=0$ and $y=2$ are equilibria; $y=2$ is stable and $y=0$ is unstable."
  A : $y=0$ and $y=2$ are equilibria and both are unstable.
  B : Only $y=0$ is an equilibrium solution.
  C : $y=2$ is stable and $y=0$ is unstable.
  D ✓: $y=0$ and $y=2$ are equilibria; $y=2$ is stable and $y=0$ is unstable.
EXPLANATION: Equilibria satisfy $y(2-y)=0\Rightarrow y=0,2$. If $0<y<2$, then $y''>0$ so solutions rise; if $y>2$, then $y''<0$ so solutions fall. Thus $y=2$ is stable and $y=0$ is unstable.

CORRECT: B = "$2.5$"
  A : $2.25$
  B ✓: $2.5$
  C : $3$
  D : $1.5$
EXPLANATION: Two steps: $(x_0,y_0)=(0,1)$. $y_1=1+0.5(1)=1.5$ at $x=0.5$. Next slope $=0.5+1.5=2$. So $y_2=1.5+0.5(2)=2.5$ at $x=1$.

  C ✓: $y+\dfrac{y^3}{3}=\dfrac{x^2}{2}+C$
  D : $y^2=\dfrac{x^2}{2}+C$
EXPLANATION: Separate: $(1+y^2)dy=x\,dx$. Integrate: $\int(1+y^2)dy=\int x\,dx\Rightarrow y+\tfrac{y^3}{3}=\tfrac{x^2}{2}+C$.
MICRO:

PROMPT: Solve the initial value problem $\dfrac{dy}{dx}=3xy$, $y(0)=2$, and find $y(1)$.
CORRECT: C = "$2e^{\frac{3}{2}}$"
  A : $2e^{3}$
  B : $2e$
  C ✓: $2e^{\frac{3}{2}}$
  D : $2e^{\frac{3}{4}}$
EXPLANATION: Separate: $\dfrac{1}{y}dy=3x\,dx$. Integrate: $\ln|y|=\tfrac{3}{2}x^2+C$. Use $y(0)=2$ to get $C=\ln 2$, so $y=2e^{\tfrac{3}{2}x^2}$ and $y(1)=2e^{\frac{3}{2}}$.

PROMPT: A cup of coffee cools in a room at $20^\circ\text{C}$ and satisfies $\dfrac{dT}{dt}=-k(T-20)$. If $T(0)=100$ and $T(10)=60$, what is $T(20)$?
CORRECT: B = "$40$"
  A : $30$
  B ✓: $40$
  C : $35$
  D : $50$
EXPLANATION: Let $u=T-20$. Then $u''=-ku$ so $u(t)=80e^{-kt}$. Given $u(10)=40$, we get $e^{-10k}=\tfrac12$. Then $u(20)=80(\tfrac12)^2=20$, so $T(20)=20+20=40$.

CORRECT: B = "$32$"
  A : $20$
  B ✓: $32$
  C : $40$
  D : $80$
EXPLANATION: Plug in $P=100$: $P''(0)=0.4\cdot100\left(1-\frac{100}{500}\right)=40\cdot0.8=32$.

PROMPT: Solve the initial value problem $\dfrac{dy}{dx}=(y-1)^2$, $y(0)=0$. Which solution is correct (for $x>-1$)?
CORRECT: A = "$y=1-\dfrac{1}{x+1}$"
  A ✓: $y=1-\dfrac{1}{x+1}$
  B : $y=1-\dfrac{1}{x-1}$
  C : $y=1-\dfrac{1}{1-x}$
  D : $y=1+\dfrac{1}{x+1}$
EXPLANATION: Separate: $\dfrac{dy}{(y-1)^2}=dx$. Integrate: $-\dfrac{1}{y-1}=x+C$. Use $y(0)=0$: $-\dfrac{1}{-1}=1=C$. So $-\dfrac{1}{y-1}=x+1\Rightarrow y=1-\dfrac{1}{x+1}$ (for $x>-1$).
MICRO:
  A: Correct. This follows the principles for solving or interpreting differential equations.
  B: Incorrect. This option fails to align with the rules of separation, integration, or initial condition application.

  A : $y=e^{x^2}$
  B : $y=e^{x}$
  C : $y=\dfrac{x^2}{2}+1$
  D ✓: $y=e^{\frac{x^2}{2}}$
EXPLANATION: Separate: $\dfrac{1}{y}dy=x\,dx$. Integrate: $\ln|y|=\tfrac{x^2}{2}+C$. With $y(0)=1$, $C=0$ and $y=e^{\frac{x^2}{2}}$.

CORRECT: C = "${\dfrac{\ln 2}{0.3}}$"
  A : ${\dfrac{\ln 2}{0.6}}$
  B : ${\dfrac{2}{0.3}}$
  C ✓: ${\dfrac{\ln 2}{0.3}}$
  D : $\ln(0.3)$
EXPLANATION: Solution: $V(t)=V(0)e^{-0.3t}$. Half-life: $\tfrac12= e^{-0.3t}\Rightarrow t=\dfrac{\ln 2}{0.3}$.

PROMPT: Given $\dfrac{dy}{dx}=\dfrac{2y}{x}$ and $y(3)=5$, what is $y(6)$?
CORRECT: A = "$20$"
  A ✓: $20$
  B : $15$
  C : $10$
  D : $25$
EXPLANATION: Separate: $\dfrac{1}{y}dy=\dfrac{2}{x}dx\Rightarrow \ln y=2\ln x+C\Rightarrow y=Cx^2$. Use $y(3)=5$ so $C=\frac{5}{9}$. Then $y(6)= (\frac{5}{9})\cdot36=20$.
MICRO:
  A: Correct. Slope fields provide a visual representation of a differential equation $dy/dx = f(x,y)$. The solution curves must follow the slopes indicate
  B: Incorrect. Verify the slope at specific coordinate points $(x, y)$ by plugging them into the differential equation and checking if they match the slop

  D : $72\%$
EXPLANATION: Relative error is $\dfrac{|e-2|}{e}$. Using $e\approx 2.718$ gives $\dfrac{0.718}{2.718}\approx 0.264$, or $26\%$.

CORRECT: D = "$2.5$"
  A : $1.5$
  B : $2.25$

PROMPT: A family of functions is given by $y=x^2+C$. If $y$ satisfies $y''=2x$ and $y(1)=3$, what is $y(4)$?
CORRECT: A = "$18$"
  A ✓: $18$
  B : $17$

PROMPT: A population satisfies $\dfrac{dP}{dt}=P(3-P)$ with $P(0)=4$. What is $\displaystyle\lim_{t\to\infty}P(t)$?
CORRECT: D = "$3$"
  A : $0$
  B : $4$
  C : $\infty$
  D ✓: $3$
EXPLANATION: Equilibria: $P=0,3$. If $P>3$, then $P''<0$ so $P$ decreases. If $0<P<3$, then $P''>0$ so $P$ increases. Thus solutions approach $3$.

--- 7.0-UT-Q18 [1/1] [Both] ---
PROMPT: For $\dfrac{dy}{dx}=x-y$ with initial condition $y(0)=1$, is the solution initially increasing or decreasing at $x=0$?
CORRECT: C = "Decreasing, because $x-y<0$ at $(0,1)$."
  A : Increasing, because $x-y>0$ at $(0,1)$.
  B : Neither; the slope is $0$ at $(0,1)$.
  C ✓: Decreasing, because $x-y<0$ at $(0,1)$.
  D : Cannot be determined without solving explicitly.
EXPLANATION: Evaluate the slope at the initial point: $y''(0)=0-1=-1<0$, so the solution decreases initially.
MICRO:
  A: Incorrect. This option fails to align with the rules of separation, integration, or initial condition application.
  B: Incorrect. This option fails to align with the rules of separation, integration, or initial condition application.
  C: Correct. This follows the principles for solving or interpreting differential equations.

  A : $\ln 4$
  B ✓: $5\ln 4$
  C : $\dfrac{\ln(200)}{\ln(50)}$
  D : $\dfrac{150}{0.2}$
EXPLANATION: Solution: $N(t)=50e^{0.2t}$. Set $200=50e^{0.2t}$ so $4=e^{0.2t}$ and $t=\dfrac{\ln4}{0.2}=5\ln4$.
MICRO:

--- 7.0-UT-Q20 [5/5] [Both] ---
PROMPT: For the autonomous differential equation $\dfrac{dy}{dt}=y^2-y$, which statement is correct?
CORRECT: A = "$y=0$ and $y=1$ are equilibria; $y=0$ is stable and $y=1$ is unstable."
  A ✓: $y=0$ and $y=1$ are equilibria; $y=0$ is stable and $y=1$ is unstable.
  B : $y=1$ is stable and $y=0$ is unstable.
  C : The only equilibrium is $y=0$, and it is unstable.
  D : $y=0$ and $y=1$ are equilibria and both are stable.
EXPLANATION: Equilibria: $y(y-1)=0\Rightarrow y=0,1$. If $0<y<1$, then $y(y-1)<0$ so $y$ decreases toward $0$. If $y<0$, then $y(y-1)>0$ so $y$ increases toward $0$. Thus $y=0$ is stable. Near $y=1$, values slightly less than $1$ move down and values slightly greater than $1$ move up, so $y=1$ is unstable.

--- 7.1-P1 [2/2] [Both] ---
PROMPT: A bacteria culture has population $P(t)$ (in thousands) at time $t$ hours. The instantaneous rate of change of the population is proportional to the square root of the population, and the population is increasing. Which differential equation models this situation?  I. $\dfrac{dP}{dt}=k\sqrt{P}$ II. $\dfrac{dP}{dt}=kP^2$ III. $\dfrac{dP}{dt}=-k\sqrt{P}$  Assume $k>0$ is a constant.
CORRECT: C = "I only"
  A : III only
  B : II only
  C ✓: I only
  D : I and II
EXPLANATION: “Rate is proportional to the square root of the population” translates to $\dfrac{dP}{dt}=k\sqrt{P}$ for some constant $k$. Since the population is increasing, the derivative must be positive, so no negative sign is included. Thus I only.
MICRO:
  A: Wrong sign (decreasing).
  B: Wrong power of $P$.
  C: Matches $\sqrt{P}$ and increasing.
  D: Includes an incorrect model.

--- 7.1-P2 [3/2] [Both] ---
PROMPT: Let $V(t)$ be the volume of water (in liters) in a tank at time $t$ minutes. Water drains from the tank at a rate proportional to the volume in the tank, and the constant of proportionality is $0.04\ \text{min}^{-1}$. Which differential equation correctly models $V(t)$?
CORRECT: B = "$\dfrac{dV}{dt}=-0.04V$"
  A : $\dfrac{dV}{dt}=0.04V$
  B ✓: $\dfrac{dV}{dt}=-0.04V$
  C : $\dfrac{dV}{dt}=-\dfrac{0.04}{V}$
  D : $\dfrac{dV}{dt}=-0.04t$
EXPLANATION: “Rate proportional to volume” gives $\dfrac{dV}{dt}=kV$. Draining means $\dfrac{dV}{dt}<0$ for $V>0$, so $k$ must be negative. With magnitude $0.04\ \text{min}^{-1}$, the model is $\dfrac{dV}{dt}=-0.04V$.
MICRO:
  A: Wrong sign (increasing).
  B: Correct proportionality and sign.
  C: Wrong dependence on $V$.
  D: Depends on $t$, not $V$.

--- 7.1-P3 [1/1] [Both] ---
PROMPT: A quantity $y$ is measured in grams and depends on time $t$ measured in seconds. Which statement best interprets $\dfrac{dy}{dt}=-5$ at $t=12$?
CORRECT: A = "At $t=12$, $y$ is decreasing at $5$ grams per second."
  A ✓: At $t=12$, $y$ is decreasing at $5$ grams per second.
  B : At $t=12$, $y=-5$ grams.
  C : At $t=12$, $y$ is increasing at $5$ grams per second.
  D : At $t=12$, $t$ is decreasing at $5$ seconds per gram.
EXPLANATION: $\dfrac{dy}{dt}$ gives the instantaneous rate of change of $y$ with respect to $t$. The value $-5$ means $y$ decreases at $5$ grams per second at that instant.
MICRO:
  A: A negative derivative means decreasing; magnitude $5$ gives the rate.
  B: $\dfrac{dy}{dt}$ is a rate of change, not the value of $y$.
  C: Sign is wrong: derivative is negative.
  D: This inverts the derivative and swaps variables/units.

--- 7.1-P4 [4/3] [Both] ---
PROMPT: A function $y(t)$ satisfies the differential equation $$\frac{dy}{dt}=3t^2-2y.$$ If $y(1)=4$, what is the value of $\left.\dfrac{dy}{dt}\right|_{t=1}$?
CORRECT: A = "$-5$"
  A ✓: $-5$
  B : $-2$
  C : $11$
  D : $1$
EXPLANATION: The differential equation gives the derivative in terms of $t$ and $y$. At $t=1$, $y=4$, so $$\left.\frac{dy}{dt}\right|_{t=1}=3(1)^2-2(4)=3-8=-5.$$
MICRO:
  A: Direct substitution into the DE.
  B: Arithmetic/sign slip.
  C: Sign error on the $-2y$ term.
  D: Does not use the equation.

--- 7.1-P5 [3/2] [Both] ---
PROMPT: A quantity $y$ is measured in meters and depends on time $t$ in seconds. Suppose $\dfrac{dy}{dt}=ky$ where $k$ is a constant. What are the correct units for $k$?
CORRECT: D = "$\text{s}^{-1}$"
  A : meters
  B : seconds
  C : $\text{m}\cdot\text{s}^{-1}$
  D ✓: $\text{s}^{-1}$
EXPLANATION: Since $\dfrac{dy}{dt}$ has units $\text{m}/\text{s}$ and $y$ has units $\text{m}$, the constant $k$ must have units $\dfrac{1}{\text{s}}$ so that $ky$ has units $\text{m}/\text{s}$.
MICRO:
  A: Ignores matching units of both sides.
  B: Uses seconds instead of per second.
  C: Creates wrong units.
  D: Correct: $k$ is per second.

--- 7.2-P1 [2/3] [Both] ---
PROMPT: Which function is a solution to the differential equation $$\frac{dy}{dx}=2x(y-1)$$ for $y(x)$?
CORRECT: A = "$y=1+e^{x^2}$"
  A ✓: $y=1+e^{x^2}$
  B : $y=1+e^{2x}$
  C : $y=1+x^2$
  D : $y=e^{x^2}$
EXPLANATION: To verify, compute $y'$ and substitute into the right side. For $y=1+e^{x^2}$, $y'=2xe^{x^2}$ and $2x(y-1)=2x(e^{x^2})=2xe^{x^2}$. The two sides match for all $x$, so it is a solution.
MICRO:
  A: Derivative matches RHS exactly.
  B: Missing factor of $x$.

PROMPT: A function $y(x)$ is claimed to solve $$\frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{y}{x}$$ with initial condition $y(2)=6$. Which of the following functions satisfies BOTH the differential equation and the initial condition (for $x>0$)?
CORRECT: C = "$y=3x$"
  A : $y=6x$
  B : $y=\dfrac{6}{x}$
  C ✓: $y=3x$
  D : $y=3x^2$
EXPLANATION: Check each candidate. For $y=3x$, $y'=3$ and $\dfrac{y}{x}=3$, so it satisfies the DE. Also $y(2)=3\cdot 2=6$, so it satisfies the initial condition.
MICRO:
  A: Fails the initial condition.

  D: Fails the DE.

PROMPT: Let $y(x)=\ln(x^2+1)$. Does $y$ satisfy the differential equation $$\frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{2x}{x^2+1}?$$
CORRECT: B = "Yes, because $\dfrac{dy}{dx}=\dfrac{2x}{x^2+1}$."
  A : No, because $\dfrac{dy}{dx}=\dfrac{1}{x^2+1}$.
  B ✓: Yes, because $\dfrac{dy}{dx}=\dfrac{2x}{x^2+1}$.
  C : No, because $\dfrac{dy}{dx}=\dfrac{2}{x^2+1}$.
  D : Yes, because $\dfrac{dy}{dx}=\dfrac{x^2+1}{2x}$.
EXPLANATION: Differentiate $y=\ln(x^2+1)$ using the chain rule. Let $u=x^2+1$, so $u'=2x$. Then $$\frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{u'}{u}=\frac{2x}{x^2+1},$$ which matches the differential equation. So the answer is yes.

PROMPT: A student claims that $y=x^2-1$ is a solution to $$\frac{dy}{dx}=2x.$$ Which statement is correct?
CORRECT: B = "It is a solution, because $\dfrac{dy}{dx}=2x$."
  A : Not a solution, because $y$ is negative when $x=0$.
  B ✓: It is a solution, because $\dfrac{dy}{dx}=2x$.
  C : Not a solution, because $\dfrac{dy}{dx}=x$.
  D : It is a solution only for $x\ge 0$.
EXPLANATION: To verify, compute $y'$. For $y=x^2-1$, $y'=2x$, which matches the right-hand side exactly, so it is a solution for all real $x$.
MICRO:
  A: Verification depends on $y'$, not the sign of $y$.
  B: Correct verification.
  C: Derivative is miscomputed.
  D: No domain restriction is needed here.

PROMPT: Consider the differential equation (for $x>0$) $$x\frac{dy}{dx}+y=\sqrt{x}.$$ Which function satisfies the equation for $x>0$?

  A : $y=\sqrt{x}$
  B : $y=\dfrac{1}{\sqrt{x}}$
  C : $y=\dfrac{2}{3}x$
  D ✓: $y=\dfrac{2}{3}\sqrt{x}$
EXPLANATION: Verify by substitution. For $y=\dfrac{2}{3}\sqrt{x}$, we have $y'=\dfrac{1}{3\sqrt{x}}$ (for $x>0$). Then $$x\frac{dy}{dx}+y=x\left(\frac{1}{3\sqrt{x}}\right)+\frac{2}{3}\sqrt{x}=\frac{\sqrt{x}}{3}+\frac{2\sqrt{x}}{3}=\sqrt{x},$$ so it satisfies the differential equation on $x>0$.
MICRO:
  A: Produces $\tfrac{3}{2}\sqrt{x}$, not $\sqrt{x}$.
  B: Produces $\tfrac{1}{2\sqrt{x}}$, not $\sqrt{x}$.
  C: Left side becomes proportional to $x$.
  D: Matches exactly after substitution.

  A : $\dfrac{dy}{dx}=xy$
  B : $\dfrac{dy}{dx}=y-x$
  C : $\dfrac{dy}{dx}=x+y$

  B ✓: $2$
  C : $-\infty$
  D : $+\infty$
EXPLANATION: From the field, $y=0$ and $y=2$ are equilibrium lines. In the region $0<y<2$ the slopes are positive, so the solution increases toward the stable equilibrium $y=2$.
MICRO:

PROMPT: Use the accompanying slope field (image). Which statement about the equilibrium solution $y=0$ is correct?
IMAGE: https://xzpjlnkirboevkjzitcx.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/p...
CORRECT: D = "$y=0$ is stable because nearby solutions move toward it as $x$ increases."
  A : $y=0$ is unstable because nearby solutions move away from it.
  B : $y=0$ is neither stable nor unstable because slopes are zero everywhere.
  C : $y=0$ is not an equilibrium because the solution curve must be curved.
  D ✓: $y=0$ is stable because nearby solutions move toward it as $x$ increases.
EXPLANATION: The field shows horizontal segments on $y=0$. For $y>0$ the slopes are negative and for $y<0$ the slopes are positive, so solutions move toward $y=0$ as $x$ increases. Therefore $y=0$ is stable.

PROMPT: A solution to $\dfrac{dy}{dx}=x-y$ passes through $(0,0)$. Using slope-field reasoning (sign of $x-y$ near $x=0$), what can you conclude about $(0,0)$ on this solution curve?
CORRECT: A = "It is a local minimum on the solution curve."
  A ✓: It is a local minimum on the solution curve.
  B : It is a point of inflection on the solution curve.
  C : It is a local maximum on the solution curve.
  D : Nothing can be concluded because the slope at $(0,0)$ is $0$.
EXPLANATION: At $(0,0)$ the slope is $0$. For $x<0$ near the origin, $x-y<0$ so the solution decreases; for $x>0$ near the origin, $x-y>0$ so the solution increases. Decreasing then increasing implies a local minimum at $(0,0)$.

CORRECT: C = "$2.50$"
  A : $2.75$

PROMPT: Consider the IVP $$\frac{dy}{dx}=y,\quad y(0)=1.$$ Using Euler’s method with step size $h=1$ to approximate $y(1)$, will the Euler approximation be an overestimate or an underestimate of the exact value?
CORRECT: A = "Underestimate"
  A ✓: Underestimate
  B : Overestimate
  C : Exact (no error)
  D : Cannot be determined
EXPLANATION: The exact solution is $y=e^x$, and $y''=e^x>0$ on $[0,1]$, so $y$ is concave up. \nEuler’s method uses the tangent line at the left endpoint. For concave up functions, tangent lines lie below the curve on the interval, so the Euler approximation underestimates the exact value.

  B : Approx $y(1)=1$, error $0$
  C : Approx $y(1)=0.25$, error $0.75$
  D ✓: Approx $y(1)=0.5$, error $0.5$
EXPLANATION: Euler: $y_{n+1}=y_n+h(2x_n)$ with $h=0.5$.  $(x_0,y_0)=(0,0)$: $y_1=0+0.5(0)=0$ at $x_1=0.5$. \nAt $x_1=0.5$: $y_2=0+0.5(2\cdot 0.5)=0.5$ at $x_2=1$. \nExact: $y'=2x \Rightarrow y=x^2+C$, and $y(0)=0\Rightarrow y=x^2$, so $y(1)=1$. \nAbsolute error: $|1-0.5|=0.5$.

  A : $k\approx 0.14$
  B ✓: $k\approx 0.28$
  C : $k\approx 1.39$
  D : $k\approx -0.28$
EXPLANATION: For $\dfrac{dP}{dt}=kP$, $P(t)=P_0e^{kt}$. Using $P(0)=500$ and $P(5)=2000$: $$2000=500e^{5k}\Rightarrow 4=e^{5k}\Rightarrow k=\frac{\ln 4}{5}\approx 0.277.$$
MICRO:

  B : The population decreases by $0.06$ cells per day.
  C : The population is increasing at $6\%$ per day.
  D : The half-life is $0.06$ days.

  B : $P(t)$ increases without bound.
  C : $P(t)$ decreases and approaches $0$.
  D : $P(t)$ increases and approaches $10$.
EXPLANATION: Because $P(0)=12>10$, we have $10-P<0$, so $$\frac{dP}{dt}=P(10-P)<0,$$\nmeaning $P(t)$ decreases. In a logistic model, solutions move toward the stable equilibrium $P=10$, so $P(t)\to 10$ as $t\to\infty$.

  C : $P(t)=\dfrac{5}{1+4e^{2t}}$
  D ✓: $P(t)=\dfrac{5}{1+4e^{-2t}}$
EXPLANATION: Rewrite as $$\frac{dP}{dt}=2P\left(1-\frac{P}{5}\right)=\frac{2}{5}P(5-P).$$\nA standard logistic solution has the form $$P(t)=\frac{K}{1+Ce^{-rt}},$$\nwhere $K=5$ and $r=2$. Use $P(0)=1$: $$1=\frac{5}{1+C}\Rightarrow 1+C=5\Rightarrow C=4.$$ \nThus $$P(t)=\frac{5}{1+4e^{-2t}}.$$

CORRECT: A = "If $0 < P < K$, then $\frac{dP}{dt} > 0$."
  A ✓: If $0 < P < K$, then $\frac{dP}{dt} > 0$.
