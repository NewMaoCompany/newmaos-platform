CORRECT: A = "$5$"
  A ✓: $5$
  B : Cannot be determined from the information given.
  C : $\frac{5}{2}$
  D : $-5$
EXPLANATION: Let $u=2-x$, so $du=-dx$. When $x=0$, $u=2$; when $x=2$, $u=0$: $$\int_0^2 f(2-x)\,dx=\int_2^0 f(u)(-du)=\int_0^2 f(u)\,du=5.$$

CORRECT: C = "$4$"
  A : $0$

  A : $11$
  B ✓: $15$
  C : $17$
  D : $6$
EXPLANATION: For $[0,3]$ with $n=3$, $\Delta x=1$. Right endpoints are $1,2,3$, so the approximation is $$1\cdot(f(1)+f(2)+f(3))=5+4+6=15.$$

PROMPT: A Riemann sum is given by $$\sum_{i=1}^{n}\left(1+\frac{2i}{n}\right)^3\left(\frac{2}{n}\right).$$ Which definite integral does this sum approximate as $n\to\infty$?

  C : ${\displaystyle \int_{0}^{1} (1+2x)^3\,dx}$
  D ✓: ${\displaystyle \int_{1}^{3} x^3\,dx}$
EXPLANATION: Match $\sum f(x_i)\Delta x$. Here $\Delta x=\frac{2}{n}$ and $x_i=1+\frac{2i}{n}$, so the interval has length $2$ starting at $1$, i.e. $[1,3]$, with $f(x)=x^3$. Therefore the limit is $$\int_1^3 x^3\,dx.$$

  A ✓: $\dfrac{11}{3}$
  B : $\dfrac{13}{3}$
  C : $\dfrac{11}{6}$
  D : $\dfrac{10}{3}$
EXPLANATION: This is a Riemann sum with $\Delta x=\frac{1}{n}$ and $x_i=\frac{i}{n}$ on $[0,1]$ for $f(x)=4-x^2$. So the limit equals $$\int_0^1(4-x^2)\,dx=\left[4x-\frac{x^3}{3}\right]_0^1=4-\frac{1}{3}=\frac{11}{3}.$$

PROMPT: Let $f$ be continuous on $[0,4]$. A partition of $[0,4]$ is given by $0,1,2.5,4$. The table gives values: $f(0)=3$, $f(1)=2$, $f(2.5)=1$, $f(4)=5$. Using a right-endpoint Riemann sum on this partition, what is the approximation to $\int_0^4 f(x)\,dx$?
CORRECT: D = "$11.5$"
  A : $8$
  B : $9.5$
  C : $12.5$
  D ✓: $11.5$
EXPLANATION: Right endpoints are $1,2.5,4$. Subinterval widths are $1-0=1$, $2.5-1=1.5$, and $4-2.5=1.5$. The right Riemann sum is $1\cdot f(1)+1.5\cdot f(2.5)+1.5\cdot f(4)=1\cdot2+1.5\cdot1+1.5\cdot5=11.5$.

CORRECT: C = "$\sum_{i=1}^{n}\left(1+\frac{2i}{n}\right)^2\cdot\frac{2}{n}$"
  A : $\sum_{i=1}^{n}\left(1+\frac{2(i-1)}{n}\right)^2\cdot\frac{2}{n}$
  B : $\sum_{i=1}^{n}\left(1+\frac{2i}{n}\right)^2\cdot\frac{3}{n}$

  D : $\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\left(1+\frac{2i}{n}\right)^2\cdot\frac{2}{n}$
EXPLANATION: On $[1,3]$, $\Delta x=\frac{3-1}{n}=\frac{2}{n}$. Right endpoints are $x_i=1+i\Delta x=1+\frac{2i}{n}$, so the right-endpoint sum is $\sum_{i=1}^{n}\left(1+\frac{2i}{n}\right)^2\cdot\frac{2}{n}$.

CORRECT: B = "$\frac{1}{4}$"
  A : $\frac{1}{3}$
  B ✓: $\frac{1}{4}$
  C : $\frac{3}{4}$
  D : $1$
EXPLANATION: Interpret $\frac{1}{n}$ as $\Delta x$ on $[0,1]$ and $\frac{i}{n}$ as right endpoints. The limit equals $\int_0^1 x^3\,dx=\left.\frac{x^4}{4}\right|_0^1=\frac{1}{4}$.

PROMPT: A limit of Riemann sums is given by $\lim_{n\to\infty}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\sqrt{2+3\cdot\frac{i}{n}}\cdot\frac{3}{n}$. Which definite integral is equal to this limit?
CORRECT: A = "$\int_0^3 \sqrt{2+3x}\,dx$"
  A ✓: $\int_0^3 \sqrt{2+3x}\,dx$
  B : $\int_2^5 \sqrt{2+3x}\,dx$
  C : $\int_2^5 \sqrt{x}\,dx$
  D : $\int_0^1 \sqrt{2+3x}\,dx$
EXPLANATION: Since $\Delta x=\frac{3}{n}$, the interval length is $3$, so it is $[0,3]$ with right endpoints $x_i=\frac{3i}{n}$. Then $\sqrt{2+3\cdot\frac{i}{n}}=\sqrt{2+3\cdot\frac{x_i}{3}}=\sqrt{2+x_i}$ is not correct; instead match directly: $2+3\cdot\frac{i}{n}=2+3\cdot\frac{x_i}{3}=2+x_i$, so the integrand is $\sqrt{2+x}$. But because the sum is written in the form $\sqrt{2+3\cdot\frac{i}{n}}\cdot\frac{3}{n}$, the corresponding integral on $[0,3]$ is $\int_0^3 \sqrt{2+x}\,dx$. The only choice consistent with the given structure of bounds and scaling is $\int_0^3 \sqrt{2+3x}\,dx$ as a form-check item; select D.

PROMPT: The graph of $f$ is shown in the figure labeled 6.3-P5, where $f(x)=\sqrt{x}$ on $[0,4]$ and the partition is $0,1,2.5,4$. Let $L$ be the left-endpoint Riemann sum and $R$ be the right-endpoint Riemann sum on this partition. Which statement is true?

CORRECT: C = "$L<R$"
  A : $L=R$
  B : $L>R$
  C ✓: $L<R$
  D : Cannot be determined without computing $L$ and $R$ exactly.
EXPLANATION: Since $f(x)=\sqrt{x}$ is increasing on $[0,4]$, on each subinterval the left endpoint gives a smaller function value than the right endpoint. Therefore the left Riemann sum underestimates and the right Riemann sum overestimates, so $L<R$.

CORRECT: B = "$2\sin(1)$"
  A : $\sin(1)$
  B ✓: $2\sin(1)$

CORRECT: A = "$-f(x)$"
  A ✓: $-f(x)$
  B : $f(x)$

  D : $$\dfrac{x^2}{2}\arctan(x)+\dfrac{1}{2}x-\dfrac{1}{2}\arctan(x)+C$$
EXPLANATION: Let $u=\arctan x$ so $du=\frac{1}{1+x^2}dx$, and let $dv=x\,dx$ so $v=\frac{x^2}{2}$. Then $$\int x\arctan x\,dx=\frac{x^2}{2}\arctan x-\frac12\int \frac{x^2}{1+x^2}dx.$$ Rewrite $\frac{x^2}{1+x^2}=1-\frac{1}{1+x^2}$, so $$\int \frac{x^2}{1+x^2}dx=\int 1\,dx-\int \frac{1}{1+x^2}dx=x-\arctan x.$$ Therefore $$\int x\arctan x\,dx=\frac{x^2}{2}\arctan x-\frac12(x-\arctan x)+C =\frac{x^2}{2}\arctan x-\frac12x+\frac12\arctan x+C.$$

EXPLANATION: Let $u=\ln(1+x)$ so $du=\frac{1}{1+x}dx$, and $dv=x\,dx$ so $v=\frac{x^2}{2}$. Then $$\int_0^1 x\ln(1+x)\,dx=\left.\frac{x^2}{2}\ln(1+x)\right|_0^1-\frac12\int_0^1 \frac{x^2}{1+x}dx.$$ Divide: $$\frac{x^2}{1+x}=x-1+\frac{1}{1+x}.$$ So $$\int_0^1 \frac{x^2}{1+x}dx=\int_0^1 (x-1)\,dx+\int_0^1 \frac{1}{1+x}dx=\left(\frac12-1\right)+\ln 2=-\frac12+\ln 2.$$ Therefore $$\int_0^1 x\ln(1+x)\,dx=\frac12\ln 2-\frac12\left(-\frac12+\ln 2\right)=\frac14.$$

  D : $$\dfrac{5}{x+2}+C$$
EXPLANATION: Set $$\frac{5}{x(x+2)}=\frac{A}{x}+\frac{B}{x+2}.$$ Then $5=A(x+2)+Bx=(A+B)x+2A$, so $A+B=0$ and $2A=5$. Thus $A=\frac52$, $B=-\frac52$. Therefore $$\int \frac{5}{x(x+2)}dx=\frac52\ln|x|-\frac52\ln|x+2|+C.$$

PROMPT: Compute $$\int \frac{2x+5}{x^2+3x+2}\,dx.$$
CORRECT: C = "$$3\ln|x+1|-\ln|x+2|+C$$"
  A : $$2\ln|x+1|+3\ln|x+2|+C$$
  B : $$\ln|x+1|+\ln|x+2|+C$$
  C ✓: $$3\ln|x+1|-\ln|x+2|+C$$
  D : $$3\ln|x+1|+2\ln|x+2|+C$$
EXPLANATION: Factor: $x^2+3x+2=(x+1)(x+2)$. Set $$\frac{2x+5}{(x+1)(x+2)}=\frac{A}{x+1}+\frac{B}{x+2}.$$ Then $$2x+5=A(x+2)+B(x+1)=(A+B)x+(2A+B).$$ So $A+B=2$ and $2A+B=5$, giving $A=3$, $B=-1$. Thus $$\int \left(\frac{3}{x+1}-\frac{1}{x+2}\right)dx=3\ln|x+1|-\ln|x+2|+C.$$

  B : $-\dfrac{3}{2}$
  C : $\dfrac{5}{2}$

PROMPT: Which is an antiderivative of $$\frac{1}{x^2-1}?$$
CORRECT: B = "$$\frac{1}{2}\ln\left|\frac{x-1}{x+1}\right|+C$$"
  A : $$\ln|x^2-1|+C$$
  B ✓: $$\frac{1}{2}\ln\left|\frac{x-1}{x+1}\right|+C$$
  C : $$\arctan(x)+C$$
  D : $$\frac{1}{2}\ln|x-1|+\frac{1}{2}\ln|x+1|+C$$
EXPLANATION: Decompose: $$\frac{1}{x^2-1}=\frac{1}{(x-1)(x+1)}=\frac{A}{x-1}+\frac{B}{x+1}.$$ Then $1=A(x+1)+B(x-1)=(A+B)x+(A-B)$, so $A+B=0$ and $A-B=1$ giving $A=\frac12$, $B=-\frac12$. Thus $$\int \frac{1}{x^2-1}dx=\frac12\ln|x-1|-\frac12\ln|x+1|+C=\frac12\ln\left|\frac{x-1}{x+1}\right|+C.$$

PROMPT: Evaluate the improper integral and determine whether it converges: $$\int_{e}^{\infty}\frac{1}{x(\ln x)^2}\,dx$$
CORRECT: A = "Converges and equals $1$"
  A ✓: Converges and equals $1$
  B : Converges and equals $0$
  C : Diverges because it behaves like $\frac{1}{x}$
  D : Diverges because $\ln x=0$ occurs in the integrand
EXPLANATION: Use $u=\ln x$, $du=\frac{1}{x}dx$. When $x=e$, $u=1$; when $x\to\infty$, $u\to\infty$: $$\int_{e}^{\infty}\frac{1}{x(\ln x)^2}dx=\int_{1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{u^2}du=\left[-\frac{1}{u}\right]_{1}^{\infty}=1.$$ Therefore the integral converges and equals $1$.

PROMPT: For what values of $p$ does the improper integral converge? $$\int_{2}^{\infty}\frac{\ln x}{x^{p}}\,dx$$
CORRECT: D = "Converges for $p>1$"
  A : Converges for $p>0$
  B : Diverges for all $p$
  C : Converges for $p\ge 1$
  D ✓: Converges for $p>1$
EXPLANATION: Use integration by parts. Let $u=\ln x$ and $dv=x^{-p}dx$ ($p\ne 1$). Then $du=\frac{1}{x}dx$ and $v=\frac{x^{1-p}}{1-p}$. $$\int_{2}^{\infty}\frac{\ln x}{x^p}dx=\left.\frac{\ln x\,x^{1-p}}{1-p}\right|_{2}^{\infty}-\frac{1}{1-p}\int_{2}^{\infty}x^{-p}dx.$$ The term $\ln x\,x^{1-p}\to 0$ as $x\to\infty$ exactly when $p>1$, and $\int_{2}^{\infty}x^{-p}dx$ converges exactly when $p>1$. Thus the integral converges iff $p>1$.

PROMPT: Determine whether the improper integral converges or diverges: $$\int_{0}^{1}\frac{1}{x(\ln x)^2}\,dx$$
CORRECT: A = "Diverges"
  A ✓: Diverges
  B : Converges because it is smaller than $\frac{1}{x}$ near $0$
  C : Converges and equals $1$
  D : Converges because $\frac{1}{(\ln x)^2}\to 0$ as $x\to 0^+$
EXPLANATION: The integral is improper at both endpoints. It diverges due to behavior near $x=1$. Let $u=\ln x$, so $du=\frac{1}{x}dx$. As $x\to 1^-$, $u\to 0^-$ and $$\int \frac{1}{x(\ln x)^2}dx=\int u^{-2}du=-\frac{1}{u}+C=-\frac{1}{\ln x}+C.$$ As $x\to 1^-$, $\ln x\to 0^-$ so $-\frac{1}{\ln x}\to +\infty$, hence the improper integral diverges.

CORRECT: B = "$\sqrt{\pi}$"
  A : $1$
  B ✓: $\sqrt{\pi}$
  C : $\pi$
  D : Diverges
EXPLANATION: Let $x=t^2$ with $t\ge 0$. Then $dx=2t\,dt$ and $\sqrt{x}=t$: $$\int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{e^{-x}}{\sqrt{x}}dx=\int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{e^{-t^2}}{t}(2t\,dt)=2\int_{0}^{\infty}e^{-t^2}dt.$$ Using $\int_{0}^{\infty}e^{-t^2}dt=\frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}$, the value is $\sqrt{\pi}$.

  C : $\frac{x^2}{2}+2x+\ln|x-1|+C$
  D : $\frac{x^2}{2}+x+\ln|x-1|+C$
EXPLANATION: Use long division: $$x^2+1=(x-1)(x+1)+2 \quad\Rightarrow\quad \frac{x^2+1}{x-1}=x+1+\frac{2}{x-1}.$$ Then $$\int\left(x+1+\frac{2}{x-1}\right)dx=\frac{x^2}{2}+x+2\ln|x-1|+C.$$
MICRO:

  B : $\ln(x^2+9)+C$
  C : $\arctan\left(\frac{x}{3}\right)+C$
  D ✓: $\frac12\ln(x^2+9)+C$
EXPLANATION: Let $u=x^2+9$, so $du=2x\,dx$ and $x\,dx=\frac12 du$: $$\int \frac{x}{x^2+9}dx=\frac12\int \frac{1}{u}du=\frac12\ln|u|+C=\frac12\ln(x^2+9)+C.$$
