  B : $f(5)=-2$.
  C ✓: The tangent line to $y=f(x)$ at $x=5$ has slope $-2$.
  D : The function is decreasing for all $x$.
EXPLANATION: By definition, $f'(5)$ is the slope of the tangent line to $y=f(x)$ at $x=5$. Therefore $f'(5)=-2$ means that tangent slope is $-2$.

  A ✓: $-\dfrac{1}{a(a+h)}$
  B : $\dfrac{1}{a(a+h)}$
  C : $-\dfrac{h}{a(a+h)}$
  D : $\dfrac{a+h-a}{h}$
EXPLANATION: Compute the difference quotient: $$\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}=\frac{\frac{1}{a+h}-\frac{1}{a}}{h} =\frac{\frac{a-(a+h)}{a(a+h)}}{h} =\frac{\frac{-h}{a(a+h)}}{h} =-\frac{1}{a(a+h)}.$$

PROMPT: Use the graph (see image) to best estimate $f'(2)$. The point $(2, f(2))$ is marked on the curve.
IMAGE: https://xzpjlnkirboevkjzitcx.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/p...
CORRECT: C = "About $0.2$"
  A : About $1.2$
  B : About $2$
  C ✓: About $0.2$
  D : About $6$
EXPLANATION: The derivative at a point is the slope of the tangent line. From the graph near $x=2$, the rise over run over a small interval (e.g., from $x=1.5$ to $x=2.5$) suggests an average slope close to $2$.
MICRO:
  A: Wrong sign; increasing means positive slope.
  B: Too small; the graph rises more than /bin/zsh.2$ per $ unit of $ near $.
  C: Correct: the tangent slope is a little above $.
  D: Too steep for the visible tangent at =2$.

PROMPT: A function $f$ satisfies $f(3) = 10$, $f(3.1)=10.4$, and $f(2.9) = 9.7$. Using a symmetric difference quotient, estimate $f'(3)$.
CORRECT: D = "$3.5$"
  A : $4.0$
  B : $3.0$
  C : $7.0$
  D ✓: $3.5$
EXPLANATION: Use the symmetric difference quotient: $f'(3) \approx \frac{f(3+h)-f(3-h)}{2h}$. Here $h=0.1$, so $f'(3) \approx \frac{f(3.1)-f(2.9)}{0.2} = \frac{10.4-9.7}{0.2} = \frac{0.7}{0.2} = 3.5$.
MICRO:
  A: Uses /bin/zsh.6$ instead of the correct symmetric change /bin/zsh.7$.
  B: Extra factor of $ error.
  C: Divides by /bin/zsh.1$ rather than /bin/zsh.2$.
  D: Correct symmetric quotient: /bin/zsh.7/0.2=3.5$.

PROMPT: Let $g(x)=\sqrt{x}$. Which expression best estimates $g'(9)$ using $h=0.01$?
CORRECT: B = "$\frac{\sqrt{9.01}-\sqrt{9}}{0.01}$"
  A : $\frac{\sqrt{9}-\sqrt{8.99}}{0.01}$
  B ✓: $\frac{\sqrt{9.01}-\sqrt{9}}{0.01}$
  C : $\frac{\sqrt{9.01}-\sqrt{8.99}}{0.01}$
  D : $\frac{\sqrt{9.01}-\sqrt{9}}{9.01-9}$
EXPLANATION: A standard estimate uses $g'(a)\approx \frac{g(a+h)-g(a)}{h}$. With $a=9$ and $h=0.01$, the correct setup is $\frac{\sqrt{9.01}-\sqrt{9}}{0.01}$.
MICRO:
  A: Backward difference uses -h$.
  B: Correct forward difference at =9$.
  C: Symmetric numerator requires h$ in the denominator.
  D: Same as A; .01-9=0.01$.

PROMPT: A graph (see image) shows $y=f(x)$ and a symmetric secant line through the points at $x=1.0$ and $x=2.0$. Which value is the best estimate of $f'(1.5)$ using this symmetric secant?
IMAGE: https://xzpjlnkirboevkjzitcx.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/p...
CORRECT: A = "\frac{f(2.0) - f(1.0)}{2.0 - 1.0}"
  A ✓: \frac{f(2.0) - f(1.0)}{2.0 - 1.0}
  B : The slope of the secant from $x=1.0$ to $x=1.5$ only
  C : \frac{f(2.0) - f(1.5)}{2.0 - 1.5}
  D : \frac{f(1.5) - f(1.0)}{2.0 - 1.0}
EXPLANATION: A symmetric secant about $x=a$ uses points $a-h$ and $a+h$: $$f'(a) \approx \frac{f(a+h)-f(a-h)}{2h}$$ Here $a=1.5$ and the points are $1.0$ and $2.0$ (so $h=0.5$). Thus, $$f'(1.5) \approx \frac{f(2.0)-f(1.0)}{2.0-1.0} = \frac{f(2.0)-f(1.0)}{1.0}$$
MICRO:
  A: Correct midpoint estimate: symmetric secant slope.
  B: Not symmetric; uses only one side of =1.5$.
  C: Right-side secant only.
  D: Denominator should match the chosen numerator interval.

PROMPT: The position of a particle is (t)$ (meters). A table gives (4)=18.2$, (4.05)=18.7$, and (3.95)=17.6$. Estimate the instantaneous velocity '(4)$ (m/s) using a symmetric difference quotient.
CORRECT: C = "$11\ \text{m/s}$"
  A : $10\ \text{m/s}$
  B : $5.5\ \text{m/s}$
  C ✓: $11\ \text{m/s}$
  D : $22\ \text{m/s}$
EXPLANATION: Use 19967s'(4)\approx \frac{s(4+0.05)-s(4-0.05)}{2(0.05)}=\frac{s(4.05)-s(3.95)}{0.10}.19967 Then 19967\frac{18.7-17.6}{0.10}=11\text{ m/s}.19967
MICRO:
  A: Incorrect. $10$ comes from using only one side: $(18.7-18.2)/0.05=10$, which is a one-sided difference quotient, not symmetric.
  B: Incorrect. $5.5$ likely comes from dividing the numerator by $0.2$ instead of $0.10$.
  C: Correct. Symmetric difference quotient: $\frac{s(4.05)-s(3.95)}{2(0.05)}=\frac{18.7-17.6}{0.10}=11$ m/s.
  D: Incorrect. $22$ comes from using $\frac{1.1}{0.05}$ instead of dividing by $2h=0.10$.

--- 2.4-P1 [2/2] [Both] ---
PROMPT: Which statement is always true for a function $f$ at $x=a$? I. If $f$ is differentiable at $x=a$, then $f$ is continuous at $x=a$. II. If $f$ is continuous at $x=a$, then $f$ is differentiable at $x=a$.
CORRECT: D = "I only"
  A : Neither I nor II
  B : II only
  C : Both I and II
  D ✓: I only
EXPLANATION: Differentiability at $x=a$ forces $\lim_{x\to a}f(x)=f(a)$, so $f$ must be continuous at $x=a$. But continuity can occur without differentiability (e.g., corners).
MICRO:
  A: I is true, so not neither.
  B: Continuity alone does not ensure a derivative.
  C: II is false at corners/cusps.
  D: Correct implication: differentiable $\Rightarrow$ continuous.

--- 2.4-P2 [3/3] [Both] ---
PROMPT: Let $f(x)=|x-2|$. Which statement best describes $f$ at $x=2$?
CORRECT: B = "Continuous but not differentiable at $x=2$."
  A : Discontinuous at $x=2$.
  B ✓: Continuous but not differentiable at $x=2$.
  C : Continuous and differentiable at $x=2$.
  D : Differentiable but not continuous at $x=2$.
EXPLANATION: The graph of $f(x)=|x-2|$ has a sharp corner (cusp) at $x=2$. The function is continuous everywhere, but the one-sided derivatives differ at $x=2$: the left derivative is $-1$ and the right derivative is $1$. Since these are not equal, $f'(2)$ does not exist.
MICRO:
  A: No jump/hole: absolute value is continuous.
  B: Correct: continuous, but left/right slopes differ.
  C: Corner means not differentiable.
  D: Impossible: differentiable implies continuous.

--- 2.4-P3 [4/4] [Both] ---
PROMPT: Define $f(x)=\begin{cases} \frac{x^2-1}{x-1}, & x\ne 1 \\ 3, & x=1 \end{cases}$. Which statement is true about $f$ at $x=1$?
CORRECT: A = "Not continuous and not differentiable at $x=1$"
  A ✓: Not continuous and not differentiable at $x=1$
  B : Continuous at $x=1$, but not differentiable at $x=1$
  C : Continuous and differentiable at $x=1$
  D : Not continuous at $x=1$, but differentiable at $x=1$
EXPLANATION: For $x\ne 1$, $\frac{x^2-1}{x-1} = x+1$. So $\lim_{x\to 1}f(x) = 1+1=2$. However, $f(1)=3$. Since $\lim_{x\to 1}f(x) \ne f(1)$, $f$ is not continuous at $x=1$, and thus not differentiable there.
MICRO:
  A: Correct: (1)$ does not equal the limit.
  B: If continuous here, it would be a line and differentiable.
  C: Continuity fails because (1)\ne 2$.
  D: Differentiability cannot hold without continuity.

--- 2.4-P4 [4/4] [Both] ---
PROMPT: Let $h(x)=\begin{cases} x\sin\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) & x\ne 0 \\ 0 & x=0 \end{cases}$. Which statement is true about $h$ at $x=0$?
CORRECT: D = "Continuous at $x=0$ but not differentiable at $x=0$"
  A : Not continuous at $x=0$
  B : Continuous and differentiable at $x=0$
  C : Differentiable at $x=0$ but not continuous at $x=0$
  D ✓: Continuous at $x=0$ but not differentiable at $x=0$
EXPLANATION: Continuity: $|x \sin(\frac{1}{x})| \le |x| \to 0$, so $\lim_{x\to 0} h(x) = 0 = h(0)$. Differentiability: $h'(0)=\lim_{t\to 0} \sin(1/t)$ which does not exist. Hence continuous but not differentiable at $x=0$.
MICRO:
  A: Continuity actually holds by squeeze.
  B: Derivative limit does not converge.
  C: Cannot be differentiable without continuity.
  D: Correct: derivative limit oscillates and fails to exist.

CORRECT: C = "$f$ is continuous but not differentiable at $x=0$"
  A : $f$ is differentiable at $x=0$
  B : $f$ is not continuous at $x=0$ but is differentiable at $x=0$
  C ✓: $f$ is continuous but not differentiable at $x=0$
  D : $f$ is neither continuous nor differentiable at $x=0$
EXPLANATION: From the graph, the two pieces meet at $x=0$, so $\lim_{x\to 0} f(x) = f(0)$ and $f$ is continuous. The one-sided slopes at $x=0$ do not match, so $f$ is not differentiable at $x=0$.
MICRO:
  A: Corner implies derivative does not exist.
  B: Impossible because differentiable implies continuous.
  C: Correct: continuous meeting point, but different one-sided slopes.
  D: Continuity holds at $.

  B : $f'(x)=28x^3-6x+5$
  C ✓: $f'(x)=28x^3-6x$
  D : $f'(x)=28x^3-3x$
EXPLANATION: Using linearity and the power rule, $$f'(x)= (7x^4)'-(3x^2)'+(5)'=28x^3-6x+0=28x^3-6x.$$

  C : $g'(x)=-\dfrac{15}{x^2}-\dfrac{1}{\sqrt{x}}$
  D : $g'(x)=-\dfrac{15}{x^4}+\dfrac{1}{\sqrt{x}}$
EXPLANATION: Convert to exponents: $$g(x)=5x^{-3}-2x^{\frac{1}{2}}.$$ Differentiate: $$g'(x)=-15x^{-4}-x^{\frac{-1}{2}}=-\frac{15}{x^4}-\frac{1}{\sqrt{x}}.$$

CORRECT: B = "$5$"
  A : $11$
  B ✓: $5$
  C : $7$
  D : $6$
EXPLANATION: Because the instruction forbids the product rule, expand first: $$h(x)=x^2(3x^3-4x+1)=3x^5-4x^3+x^2.$$ Then $$h'(x)=15x^4-12x^2+2x,$$ so $$h'(1)=15-12+2=5.$$
