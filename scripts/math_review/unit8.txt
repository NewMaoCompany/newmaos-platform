IMAGE: https://xzpjlnkirboevkjzitcx.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/p...
CORRECT: C = "$\int_0^{\frac{\pi}{4}}(\cos x-\sin x)\,dx+\int_{\frac{\pi}{4}}^{\frac{\pi}{2}}(\sin x-\cos x)\,dx$"

  A : $-\frac{32}{3}$
  B : $\frac{16}{3}$
  C ✓: $\frac{32}{3}$
  D : $\frac{64}{3}$
EXPLANATION: Intersections: $x^2-4x=0\Rightarrow x=0,4$. On $[0,4]$, $x^2-4x\le 0$, so $$A=\int_0^4(4x-x^2)\,dx=\left[2x^2-\frac{x^3}{3}\right]_0^4=32-\frac{64}{3}=\frac{32}{3}.$$

  A : $\int_0^4 \sqrt{x}\,dx$
  B ✓: $8$
  C : $\int_0^4 x^2\,dx$
  D : $4$
EXPLANATION: Square cross-sectional area is $A(x)=(\text{side})^2=(\sqrt{x})^2=x$. Thus $$V=\int_0^4 A(x)\,dx=\int_0^4 x\,dx=\left[\frac{x^2}{2}\right]_0^4=8.$$

  C : $2\pi\int_0^1(1-x)(x^2)\,dx$
  D : $\pi\int_0^1(1-y)^2\,dy$
EXPLANATION: Washers about a vertical line use $dy$. Since $y=x^2$, we have $x=\sqrt{y}$ for $0\le y\le 1$. The radius to $x=1$ is $R(y)=1-\sqrt{y}$, so $$V=\pi\int_0^1(1-\sqrt{y})^2\,dy.$$
MICRO:

--- 8.0-UT-Q12
 [4/4] [Both] ---
PROMPT: The region between $y=x$ and $y=x^2$ on $0\le x\le 1$ is shown in 8.0-UT-Q12.png. It is revolved about $y=3$. Which integral gives the volume?

  B : $\pi\int_0^1\big((3-x^2)^2-(3-x)^2\big)dx$
  C : $\pi\int_0^1\big((3-x^2)-(3-x)\big)dx$
  D ✓: $\pi\int_0^1\big((3-x)^2-(3-x^2)^2\big)dx$
EXPLANATION: Distances to $y=3$ give radii. Since $x^2\le x$ on $[0,1]$, the lower curve is $y=x^2$ and is farther from $y=3$, so $R=3-x^2$ and $r=3-x$. $$V=\pi\int_0^1\left((3-x^2)^2-(3-x)^2\right)dx.$$
MICRO:
  A: This is not the washer formula for rotation about a horizontal line.
  B: This reverses outer and inner radii; must have $R\ge r$.
  C: Missing squares on radii.
  D: Correct: outer radius uses the lower curve $y=x^2$ so $R=3-x^2$, inner uses $y=x$ so $r=3-x$.

  B : $F'(x)=\sqrt{1+2^4}$ and $F(2)=0$
  C : $F'(x)=\int_2^x \sqrt{1+t^4}\,dt$ and $F(2)=2$
  D ✓: $F'(x)=\sqrt{1+x^4}$ and $F(2)=0$
EXPLANATION: By FTC, if $F(x)=\int_2^x g(t)dt$, then $F'(x)=g(x)$. Here $g(x)=\sqrt{1+x^4}$, and $F(2)=\int_2^2 g(t)dt=0$.

CORRECT: A = "$1$"
  A ✓: $1$
  B : $2$
  C : $8$
  D : $\frac{1}{2}$
EXPLANATION: Combine adjacent integrals: $$\int_1^9 f(x)\,dx=\int_1^5 f(x)\,dx+\int_5^9 f(x)\,dx=12-4=8.$$ Average value on $[1,9]$ is $$f_{\mathrm{avg}}=\frac{1}{9-1}\int_1^9 f(x)\,dx=\frac{1}{8}\cdot 8=1.$$

  C : $\displaystyle \int_0^{\ln 4} e^x\,dx$
  D : $\displaystyle \frac{1}{4}\int_0^{\ln 4} e^x\,dx$
EXPLANATION: Average value depends on the interval length in $x$: $$f_{\mathrm{avg}}=\frac{1}{\ln 4-0}\int_0^{\ln 4} e^x\,dx=\frac{1}{\ln 4}\int_0^{\ln 4} e^x\,dx.$$

  A : $1$
  B : $\frac{4}{3}$

CORRECT: A = "$5$"
  A ✓: $5$
  B : $0$
  C : $-5$
  D : $9$
EXPLANATION: Position accumulates velocity: $$x(t)=x(0)+\int_0^t v(s)\,ds.$$ Thus $$x(3)=5+\int_0^3(4t-6)\,dt=5+[2t^2-6t]_0^3=5.$$

CORRECT: D = "$9$"
  A : $1$
  B : $5$
  C : $7$
  D ✓: $9$
EXPLANATION: Total distance traveled is $$\int_0^9 |v(t)|\,dt.$$ From the step graph: $v=1$ on $[0,5)$ gives $5$, $v=-2$ on $[5,7)$ gives $4$, and $v=0$ on $[7,9]$ gives $0$, so the total distance is $9$.

CORRECT: B = "$11$"
  A : $12$
  B ✓: $11$
  C : $-13$
  D : $-1$
EXPLANATION: Velocity accumulates from acceleration: $$v(t)=v(0)+\int_0^t a(s)\,ds.$$ So $$v(2)=-1+\int_0^2 6t\,dt=-1+[3t^2]_0^2=-1+12=11.$$

  A : $\displaystyle \int_0^5 |t^2-4t|\,dt$
  B ✓: $-\dfrac{25}{3}$
  C : $\dfrac{25}{3}$
  D : $-25$
EXPLANATION: Displacement is the signed integral of velocity: $$\text{displacement}=\int_0^5 v(t)\,dt=\int_0^5(t^2-4t)\,dt=\left[\frac{t^3}{3}-2t^2\right]_0^5=-\frac{25}{3}.$$

CORRECT: C = "$\pi$"
  A : $0$
  B : $\frac{\pi}{2}$
  C ✓: $\pi$
  D : $2\pi$
EXPLANATION: Position is accumulated velocity: $$x(t)=x(0)+\int_0^t \sin s\,ds=\int_0^t \sin s\,ds=1-\cos t.$$ On $[0,2\pi]$, $1-\cos t$ is largest when $\cos t$ is smallest, which occurs at $t=\pi$.

CORRECT: B = "$11$"
  A : $5$
  B ✓: $11$
  C : $14$
  D : $-1$
EXPLANATION: Net change in position is the integral of velocity: $$\Delta x=\int_0^3(2t-1)\,dt=\left[t^2-t\right]_0^3=9-3=6.$$ Therefore $x(3)=x(0)+\Delta x=5+6=11$.

CORRECT: A = "$$\dfrac{-1+3\sqrt{5}}{2}$$"
  A ✓: $$\dfrac{-1+3\sqrt{5}}{2}$$
  B : $$\dfrac{-1-3\sqrt{5}}{2}$$
  C : $2$
  D : $$\sqrt{11}$$
EXPLANATION: Compute $$A(x)=\left[\frac{t^3}{3}-4t\right]_1^x=\left(\frac{x^3}{3}-4x\right)-\left(\frac{1}{3}-4\right)=\frac{x^3}{3}-4x+\frac{11}{3}.$$ Set $A(x)=0$ and multiply by $3$: $x^3-12x+11=0$. Since $x=1$ is a root, factor: $(x-1)(x^2+x-11)=0$. Thus $x=\dfrac{-1\pm\sqrt{45}}{2}=\dfrac{-1\pm3\sqrt5}{2}$. The non-1 positive solution is $\dfrac{-1+3\sqrt5}{2}$.

CORRECT: C = "$2$"
  A : $14$
  B : $6$
  C ✓: $2$
  D : $$\dfrac{10}{5}$$
EXPLANATION: Since $s'(t)=v(t)$, the average value of $v$ on $[2,5]$ equals the average rate of change of $s$ on $[2,5]$: $$\frac{s(5)-s(2)}{5-2}=\frac{10-4}{3}=2.$$

  C : The instantaneous amount of water in the pool at $t=50$.
  D ✓: The total amount of water (in gallons) that enters the pool from $t=20$ to $t=50$.
EXPLANATION: Because $f(t)$ is a rate in gallons per minute, $$\int_{20}^{50} f(t)\,dt$$ accumulates gallons over that time interval. It represents the total volume of water that enters the pool from $t=20$ to $t=50$.

  A : $$\dfrac{8}{3}$$
  B : $4$
  C : $$\dfrac{2}{3}$$
  D ✓: $$\dfrac{4}{3}$$

CORRECT: A = "$4$"
  A ✓: $4$
  B : $3$
  C : $$\dfrac{7}{2}$$

EXPLANATION: Split because $|x|$ changes form at $0$, and the curves intersect when $|x|=2-x$, which occurs at $x=1$. On $[-1,0]$: $|x|=-x$ and top is $2-x$, difference $(2-x)-(-x)=2$. On $[0,1]$: top is $2-x$, difference $(2-x)-x=2-2x$. On $[1,2]$: top is $x$, difference $x-(2-x)=2x-2$. Area $$\int_{-1}^0 2\,dx+\int_0^1(2-2x)\,dx+\int_1^2(2x-2)\,dx=2+1+1=4.$$

  D : $$\displaystyle \left|\int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}} (\cos x-\sin x)\,dx\right|$$
EXPLANATION: Area requires integrating (top minus bottom) where the top curve can change. Solve $\sin x=\cos x\Rightarrow x=\frac{\pi}{4}$ in $[0,\frac{\pi}{2}]$. On $[0,\frac{\pi}{4}]$, $\cos x\ge\sin x$; on $[\frac{\pi}{4},\frac{\pi}{2}]$, $\sin x\ge\cos x$. Thus the area is $$\int_0^{\frac{\pi}{4}} (\cos x-\sin x)\,dx+\int_{\frac{\pi}{4}}^{\frac{\pi}{2}} (\sin x-\cos x)\,dx.$$

EXPLANATION: Find intersections: $(x-1)^2=3-x\Rightarrow x^2-2x+1=3-x\Rightarrow x^2-x-2=0\Rightarrow x=-1,2$. On $[-1,2]$, the line is above the parabola (e.g., at $x=0$, $3>1$). Area: $$\int_{-1}^{2}\big((3-x)-(x-1)^2\big)\,dx=\int_{-1}^{2} (2+x-x^2)\,dx.$$ An antiderivative is $-\frac{x^3}{3}+\frac{x^2}{2}+2x$.

EXPLANATION: Because both boundaries are given as $x$ in terms of $y$, use horizontal slices. Let $y_1<y_2$ be the intersection $y$-values found from $y^2-1=3-y$. For each $y$ between $y_1$ and $y_2$, the right boundary is $x=3-y$ and the left boundary is $x=y^2-1$. Thus the area is $$\int_{y_1}^{y_2}\big[(3-y)-(y^2-1)\big]\,dy.$$

Thus $$A=\int_{-1}^{0}(y^3-y)\,dy+\int_{0}^{1}(y-y^3)\,dy.$$ By symmetry these integrals are equal, so $$A=2\int_{0}^{1}(y-y^3)\,dy=2\left[\frac{y^2}{2}-\frac{y^4}{4}\right]_0^1=\frac12.$$

CORRECT: D = "$\frac{4}{3}$"
  A : $2$
  B : $\frac{8}{3}$
  C : $\frac{2}{3}$
  D ✓: $\frac{4}{3}$
EXPLANATION: Intersections: $2x=x^2\Rightarrow x=0,2$, giving $y=0,4$. Solve for $x$ in terms of $y$: From $y=2x$, $x=\frac{y}{2}$. From $y=x^2$ in the region, $x=\sqrt{y}$. For $0\le y\le 4$, $\frac{y}{2}\le \sqrt{y}$, so left is $x=\frac{y}{2}$ and right is $x=\sqrt{y}$. $$A=\int_0^4\left(\sqrt{y}-\frac{y}{2}\right)dy=\left[\frac{2}{3}y^{\frac{3}{2}}-\frac{y^2}{4}\right]_0^4=\frac{4}{3}.$$

CORRECT: D = "$\frac{1}{3}$"
  A : $\frac{1}{6}$
  B : $1$
  C : $\frac{2}{3}$
  D ✓: $\frac{1}{3}$
EXPLANATION: Intersections solve $|x|=x^2$. For $x\ge 0$: $x=x^2\Rightarrow x=0,1$. For $x\le 0$: $-x=x^2\Rightarrow x=0,-1$. On $[0,1]$, top is $y=x$ and bottom is $y=x^2$. By symmetry, $$A=2\int_0^1(x-x^2)\,dx=2\left[\frac{x^2}{2}-\frac{x^3}{3}\right]_0^1=\frac13.$$

PROMPT: Let $f(x)=x^3-3x$. Find the area between the graph of $y=f(x)$ and the $x$-axis on $[-2,2]$.
CORRECT: B = "$5$"
  A : $0$
  B ✓: $5$
  C : $4$
  D : $2$
EXPLANATION: Zeros: $x^3-3x=x(x^2-3)=0\Rightarrow x=-\sqrt3,0,\sqrt3$. Area is $$\int_{-2}^{2}|x^3-3x|\,dx.$$ By odd symmetry, the area is twice the area on $[0,2]$. On $(0,\sqrt3)$, $x^3-3x<0$; on $(\sqrt3,2)$, $x^3-3x>0$. So $$A=2\left(\int_{0}^{\sqrt3}-(x^3-3x)\,dx+\int_{\sqrt3}^{2}(x^3-3x)\,dx\right)=5.$$

CORRECT: B = "$4$"
  A : $0$
  B ✓: $4$
  C : $2$
  D : $\pi$
EXPLANATION: Geometric area is $$A=\int_0^{2\pi}|\sin x|\,dx=\int_0^{\pi}\sin x\,dx+\int_{\pi}^{2\pi}(-\sin x)\,dx.$$ Compute: $$\int_0^{\pi}\sin x\,dx=[-\cos x]_0^{\pi}=2,$$ $$\int_{\pi}^{2\pi}(-\sin x)\,dx=[\cos x]_{\pi}^{2\pi}=2.$$ So $A=4$.

PROMPT: Find the area between $y=\sin x$ and $y=\sin(2x)$ on $[0,2\pi]$.
CORRECT: C = "$5$"
  A : $3$
  B : $0$
  C ✓: $5$
  D : $2$
EXPLANATION: Intersections satisfy $\sin x=\sin 2x=2\sin x\cos x$. So either $\sin x=0$ giving $x=0,\pi,2\pi$, or $1=2\cos x$ giving $\cos x=\tfrac12$, so $x=\frac{\pi}{3},5\frac{\pi}{3}$. Thus split $[0,2\pi]$ at $0,\frac{\pi}{3},\pi,5\frac{\pi}{3},2\pi$. Area: $$A=\int_0^{2\pi}|\sin x-\sin 2x|\,dx,$$ and on each subinterval the sign is constant, so remove absolute value with the correct sign and add. The result is $A=5$.

CORRECT: A = "$\frac{1}{2}$"
  A ✓: $\frac{1}{2}$
  B : $0$
  C : $1$
  D : $\frac{1}{4}$
EXPLANATION: Intersections: $x=x^3\Rightarrow x(x^2-1)=0\Rightarrow x=-1,0,1$. On $[0,1]$, $x>x^3$, so gap is $(x-x^3)$. By symmetry, $$A=2\int_0^1(x-x^3)\,dx=2\left[\frac{x^2}{2}-\frac{x^4}{4}\right]_0^1=\frac12.$$

  A ✓: $\dfrac{1}{30}$
  B : $\dfrac{1}{6}$
  C : $\dfrac{1}{15}$
  D : $\dfrac{1}{20}$
EXPLANATION: For squares, $A(x)=s(x)^2$ where $s(x)$ is (top − bottom) $=x-x^2$. Thus $$V=\int_0^1 (x-x^2)^2\,dx=\int_0^1 (x^2-2x^3+x^4)\,dx=\left[\frac{x^3}{3}-\frac{x^4}{2}+\frac{x^5}{5}\right]_0^1=\frac{1}{30}.$$

PROMPT: The region $R$ is bounded by $y=\cos x$ and $y=\sin x$ on $0\le x\le \frac{\pi}{4}$. Cross-sections perpendicular to the $x$-axis are rectangles whose height is $2x$ and whose base lies in $R$. What is the volume?
CORRECT: B = "$\dfrac{\pi\sqrt2}{2}-2$"
  A : $2-\dfrac{\pi\sqrt2}{2}$
  B ✓: $\dfrac{\pi\sqrt2}{2}-2$
  C : $\dfrac{\pi\sqrt2}{4}-1$
  D : $\dfrac{\pi\sqrt2}{2}-1$
EXPLANATION: Base $=\cos x-\sin x$ and height $=2x$, so $A(x)=2x(\cos x-\sin x)$. Then $$V=\int_0^{\frac{\pi}{4}}2x(\cos x-\sin x)\,dx=2\left[ x(\sin x+\cos x)+(\cos x-\sin x)\right]_0^{\frac{\pi}{4}}.$$ At $x=\pi/4$, $\sin x=\cos x=\frac{\sqrt2}{2}$ so the bracket is $\frac{\pi}{4}\cdot\sqrt2+0$. At $x=0$, the bracket is $1$. Thus $$V=2\left(\frac{\pi\sqrt2}{4}-1\right)=\frac{\pi\sqrt2}{2}-2.$$
MICRO:
  A: Rectangle area: base·height.
  B: Base is vertical distance: $\cos x-\sin x$.

PROMPT: Let $R$ be the region bounded by $x=y^2$ and $x=2y$. Cross-sections perpendicular to the $y$-axis are squares. What is the volume of the solid?
CORRECT: D = "$\dfrac{16}{15}$"
  A : $\dfrac{16}{5}$
  B : $\dfrac{8}{15}$
  C : $\dfrac{32}{15}$
  D ✓: $\dfrac{16}{15}$
EXPLANATION: Perpendicular to the $y$-axis means integrate with respect to $y$. The square side is $$s(y)=x_{right}-x_{left}=2y-y^2,$$ with intersections from $y^2=2y\Rightarrow y=0,2$. Then $$V=\int_0^2 (2y-y^2)^2\,dy=\int_0^2 (4y^2-4y^3+y^4)\,dy=\left[\frac{4y^3}{3}-y^4+\frac{y^5}{5}\right]_0^2=\frac{16}{15}.$$

PROMPT: The base of a solid is the region under $y=4-x^2$ and above the $x$-axis. Cross-sections perpendicular to the $x$-axis are rectangles with constant height $3$. What is the volume?
CORRECT: C = "$32$"
  A : $\dfrac{32}{3}$
  B : $64$
  C ✓: $32$
  D : $16$
EXPLANATION: Since cross-sections are rectangles, $A(x)=\text{height}\cdot\text{base}=3(4-x^2)$. The region meets the $x$-axis at $4-x^2=0\Rightarrow x=\pm2$. Thus $$V=\int_{-2}^{2}3(4-x^2)\,dx=3\left[4x-\frac{x^3}{3}\right]_{-2}^{2}=32.$$
MICRO:
  A: Bounds from $4-x^2=0$: $x=\pm2$.

PROMPT: The base of a solid is the region between $y=e^{-x}$ and the $x$-axis on $0\le x\le 1$. Cross-sections perpendicular to the $x$-axis are rectangles whose height is $k$ times the base in the region. If the volume is $3(1-e^{-2})$, what is $k$?
CORRECT: C = "$6$"
  A : $3$
  B : $\dfrac{3}{2}$
  C ✓: $6$
  D : $12$
EXPLANATION: Base length is $e^{-x}-0=e^{-x}$. Rectangle height is $k$ times the base, so height $=k e^{-x}$. Area is $$A(x)=(e^{-x})(k e^{-x})=k e^{-2x}.$$ Thus $$V=\int_0^1 k e^{-2x}\,dx=\frac{k}{2}(1-e^{-2}).$$ Set equal to $3(1-e^{-2})$ to get $\frac{k}{2}=3\Rightarrow k=6$.
MICRO:
  A: Height proportional to base ⇒ area proportional to base$^2$.
  B: Match coefficients of $(1-e^{-2})$.

PROMPT: The base of a solid is the region between $y=\sqrt{x}$ and $y=0$ for $0\le x\le 4$. Cross-sections perpendicular to the $x$-axis are semicircles with diameter in the base. What is the volume?
CORRECT: D = "$\pi$"
  A : $\dfrac{\pi}{2}$
  B : $2\pi$
  C : $\dfrac{\pi}{4}$
  D ✓: $\pi$
EXPLANATION: The diameter is the vertical distance: $d(x)=\sqrt{x}-0=\sqrt{x}$. For a semicircle with diameter $d$, radius $r=\frac{d}{2}$, so $$A(x)=\frac{1}{2}\pi r^2=\frac{1}{2}\pi\left(\frac{d}{2}\right)^2=\frac{\pi}{8}d^2=\frac{\pi}{8}x.$$ Thus $$V=\int_0^4 \frac{\pi}{8}x\,dx=\frac{\pi}{8}\left[\frac{x^2}{2}\right]_0^4=\pi.$$
MICRO:
  A: Convert diameter to radius: $r=d/2$.
  B: Semicircle area becomes $\frac{\pi}{8}d^2$.

  A : $\dfrac{27\sqrt3}{4}$
  B ✓: $\dfrac{9\sqrt3}{4}$
  C : $\dfrac{9}{4}$
  D : $\dfrac{3\sqrt3}{4}$
EXPLANATION: The triangle base is the vertical distance $b(x)=x-0=x$. For equilateral triangles, $$A(x)=\frac{\sqrt3}{4}b(x)^2=\frac{\sqrt3}{4}x^2.$$ So $$V=\int_0^3 \frac{\sqrt3}{4}x^2\,dx=\frac{\sqrt3}{4}\left[\frac{x^3}{3}\right]_0^3=\frac{9\sqrt3}{4}.$$

PROMPT: The base of a solid is the region between $y=\ln x$ and $y=0$ for $1\le x\le e$. Cross-sections perpendicular to the $x$-axis are right isosceles triangles whose legs lie in the base. What is the volume?
CORRECT: C = "$\dfrac{e-2}{2}$"
  A : $e-2$
  B : $\dfrac{e-1}{2}$
  C ✓: $\dfrac{e-2}{2}$
  D : $\dfrac{e}{2}$
EXPLANATION: The leg length is the vertical distance $b(x)=\ln x-0=\ln x$. A right isosceles triangle with legs $b$ has area $$A(x)=\frac12 b^2=\frac12(\ln x)^2.$$ So $$V=\int_1^e \frac12(\ln x)^2\,dx=\frac12\left[x\big((\ln x)^2-2\ln x+2\big)\right]_1^e.$$ At $x=e$, this is $e(1-2+2)=e$. At $x=1$, this is $2$. Therefore $$V=\frac12(e-2).$$
MICRO:
  A: Use $\int (\ln x)^2 dx = x((\ln x)^2-2\ln x+2)$.
  B: Here the leg is $\ln x$ from the base region.
  C: Right triangle area: $\frac12(\text{leg})(\text{leg})$.

  A : $\dfrac{\pi}{120}$
  B : $\dfrac{\pi}{480}$
  C : $\dfrac{\pi}{60}$
  D ✓: $\dfrac{\pi}{240}$
EXPLANATION: Perpendicular to the $y$-axis implies $y$-integration. The diameter is horizontal distance: $$d(y)=x_{right}-x_{left}=y-y^2.$$ Semicircle area in terms of diameter is $$A(y)=\frac{\pi}{8}d(y)^2=\frac{\pi}{8}(y-y^2)^2.$$ So $$V=\int_0^1 \frac{\pi}{8}(y-y^2)^2\,dy=\frac{\pi}{8}\int_0^1 (y^2-2y^3+y^4)\,dy=\frac{\pi}{8}\left(\frac13-\frac12+\frac15\right)=\frac{\pi}{240}.$$

PROMPT: The base of a solid is the region between $y=2-x$ and $y=0$ for $0\le x\le 2$. Cross-sections perpendicular to the $x$-axis are isosceles right triangles whose hypotenuses lie in the base. What is the volume?
CORRECT: A = "$\dfrac{2}{3}$"
  A ✓: $\dfrac{2}{3}$
  B : $\dfrac{4}{3}$
  C : $\dfrac{1}{3}$
  D : $1$
EXPLANATION: The hypotenuse length is the vertical distance $h(x)=(2-x)-0=2-x$. For an isosceles right triangle with hypotenuse $h$, each leg is $\frac{h}{\sqrt2}$, so $$A(x)=\frac12\left(\frac{h}{\sqrt2}\right)^2=\frac{h^2}{4}.$$ Thus $$V=\int_0^2 \frac{(2-x)^2}{4}\,dx=\frac14\int_0^2 (4-4x+x^2)\,dx=\frac14\left[4x-2x^2+\frac{x^3}{3}\right]_0^2=\frac{2}{3}.$$

EXPLANATION: Disc method about the $x$-axis uses $V=\pi\int_a^b [r(x)]^2\,dx$ with $r(x)=y$. Here $y=2x$ and $x$ runs from $0$ to $3$, so $$V=\pi\int_0^3 (2x)^2\,dx.$$

EXPLANATION: Disc method about the $x$-axis gives $$V=\pi\int_1^{e} (\ln x)^2\,dx.$$ Use $$\int (\ln x)^2\,dx=x\big((\ln x)^2-2\ln x+2\big)+C.$$ Evaluate: at $x=e$ gives $e(1-2+2)=e$; at $x=1$ gives $1(0-0+2)=2$. So $\int_1^e (\ln x)^2\,dx=e-2$, hence $V=\pi(e-2)$.

  A : $\dfrac{16\pi}{3}$
  B : $4\pi$
  C : $\dfrac{10\pi}{3}$
  D ✓: $\dfrac{8\pi}{3}$
EXPLANATION: Revolve about $y=1$. With vertical slices, distances to the axis are $1$ and $|\sqrt{x}-1|$, so washer area is $$\pi\left(1^2-(|\sqrt{x}-1|)^2\right)=\pi\left(1-(\sqrt{x}-1)^2\right).$$ Simplify: $1-(\sqrt{x}-1)^2=2\sqrt{x}-x$. Thus $$V=\pi\int_0^4(2\sqrt{x}-x)\,dx=\pi\left[\frac{4}{3}x^{\frac{3}{2}}-\frac{x^2}{2}\right]_0^4=\pi\left(\frac{32}{3}-8\right)=\frac{8\pi}{3}.$$

EXPLANATION: About $y=-1$, outer radius to $y=2$ is $R=3$ and inner radius to $y=x^2$ is $r=x^2+1$. $$V=\pi\int_0^1\left(R^2-r^2\right)dx=\pi\int_0^1\left(9-(x^2+1)^2\right)dx.$$ Since $(x^2+1)^2=x^4+2x^2+1$, integrand is $8-2x^2-x^4$. $$\int_0^1(8-2x^2-x^4)\,dx=\left[8x-\frac{2}{3}x^3-\frac{1}{5}x^5\right]_0^1=8-\frac{2}{3}-\frac{1}{5}=\frac{107}{15}.$$ So $V=\dfrac{107\pi}{15}$.

  C : $\pi\left(\dfrac{e^2-1}{2}+2e-3\right)$
  D ✓: $\pi\left(\dfrac{e^2-1}{2}+2e-5\right)$
EXPLANATION: Rotate about $x=-1$ using washers with $dy$. Since $y=\ln x$, write $x=e^y$, and $y$ runs from $0$ to $1$. Left boundary is $x=1$. Radii are distances to $x=-1$: $R(y)=e^y+1$, $r(y)=2$. $$V=\pi\int_0^1\left((e^y+1)^2-2^2\right)dy=\pi\int_0^1\left(e^{2y}+2e^y-3\right)dy.$$ $$\int_0^1\left(e^{2y}+2e^y-3\right)dy=\left[\frac{1}{2}e^{2y}+2e^y-3y\right]_0^1=\frac{e^2-1}{2}+2(e-1)-3.$$ Hence $V=\pi\left(\frac{e^2-1}{2}+2e-5\right)$.

EXPLANATION: Use washers with $dy$ about $x=2$. For $y\in[0,2]$, segment runs from $x=0$ to $x=y+1$. Outer radius is $R=|2-0|=2$. Inner radius is $r=|2-(y+1)|=|1-y|$. $$V=\pi\int_0^2\left(R^2-r^2\right)dy=\pi\int_0^2\left(4-(1-y)^2\right)dy.$$ $$\int_0^2 (1-y)^2dy=\left[\frac{(y-1)^3}{3}\right]_0^2=\frac{1-(-1)}{3}=\frac{2}{3}.$$ Thus $V=\pi\left(8-\frac{2}{3}\right)=\frac{22\pi}{3}$.

EXPLANATION: Use parametric arc length: $$L=\int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}}\sqrt{\left(\frac{dx}{dt}\right)^2+\left(\frac{dy}{dt}\right)^2}\,dt.$$ Here $\frac{dx}{dt}=-\sin t$ and $\frac{dy}{dt}=\cos t$, so the integrand is $\sqrt{\sin^2 t+\cos^2 t}=1$.

EXPLANATION: Compute derivatives: $\frac{dx}{dt}=2t$ and $\frac{dy}{dt}=2t^2$. Then $$L=\int_0^1\sqrt{(2t)^2+(2t^2)^2}\,dt=\int_0^1 2t\sqrt{1+t^2}\,dt.$$ Let $u=1+t^2$, so $du=2t\,dt$. When $t=0$, $u=1$; when $t=1$, $u=2$. Thus $$L=\int_1^2\sqrt{u}\,du=\left[\frac{2}{3}u^{\frac{3}{2}}\right]_1^2=\frac{2}{3}\left(2\sqrt{2}-1\right).$$

PROMPT: Find the exact arc length of $y=x^2$ on the interval $0\le x\le 1$.
CORRECT: D = "$\frac{1}{4}\left(2\sqrt{5}+\ln\left(2+\sqrt{5}\right)\right)$"
  A : $\frac{1}{4}\left(2\sqrt{5}-\ln\left(2+\sqrt{5}\right)\right)$
  B : $\sqrt{5}$
  C : $\frac{7}{3}$
  D ✓: $\frac{1}{4}\left(2\sqrt{5}+\ln\left(2+\sqrt{5}\right)\right)$
EXPLANATION: For $y=x^2$, we have $y'=2x$, so $$L=\int_0^1\sqrt{1+(2x)^2}\,dx=\int_0^1\sqrt{1+4x^2}\,dx.$$ A standard antiderivative is $$\int\sqrt{1+4x^2}\,dx=\frac{x}{2}\sqrt{1+4x^2}+\frac{1}{4}\ln\left(2x+\sqrt{1+4x^2}\right)+C.$$ Evaluating from $0$ to $1$ gives $$L=\frac{1}{4}\left(2\sqrt{5}+\ln\left(2+\sqrt{5}\right)\right).$$

--- 8.13-P5 [3/3] [BC] ---
PROMPT: A particle's position is $s(t)=t^3-6t^2+9t$ for $0\le t\le 4$. What is the total distance traveled on $[0,4]$?
CORRECT: A = "$12$"
  A ✓: $12$
  B : $4$
  C : $8$
  D : $0$
EXPLANATION: Velocity is $v(t)=s'(t)=3t^2-12t+9=3(t-1)(t-3)$, so sign changes occur at $t=1$ and $t=3$. Compute positions: $s(0)=0$, $s(1)=4$, $s(3)=0$, and $s(4)=4$. Total distance is $$|s(1)-s(0)|+|s(3)-s(1)|+|s(4)-s(3)|=|4-0|+|0-4|+|4-0|=12.$$
